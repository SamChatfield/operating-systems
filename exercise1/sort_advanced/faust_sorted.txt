"First to get children, and then get them bread;
"He scents the Jesuits' traces."
"If I a birdie were!" so runs her song,
"In the beginning was the Power!"
"In the beginning was the Sense!" Take heed,
"Linger awhile! so fair thou art!"
"My child," she cries, "ill-gotten good
"No time had I to gape, or take my ease," he said,
"Now that's a stupid trick!" she said, Juchhe! Juchhe!
"Self-conquest is true victory.
"So to forsake my business and my wife!
"This shows a pious mind!" Quoth he:
"Though she, God knows, was more to blame than I."
"Unlock'd the spirit-world is lying,
"Who were restored?" none cared to ask.
"Wretch that I was," quoth he, with parting breath,
'Gainst others' sin to speak my mind!
'Thus children's wonder you'll excite,
'Tis I!
'Tis I!
'Tis I! O come!
'Tis I. Pray what have you to say to me?
'Tis a gift-horse, at least, she thought,
'Tis a ragout—success most needs attend it;
'Tis a strange gentleman, I see.
'Tis all your fault; your part you do not bear,
'Tis but a jest;
'Tis courteous in so great a lord as he,
'Tis done! Full soon thou'lt see my exultation;
'Tis easier then to feel one's way.
'Tis easy to serve up, as easy to invent.
'Tis ever taught and babbled in the schools.
'Tis feeling all;
'Tis he! 'Tis he! Him from my presence chase!
'Tis he! 'Tis he! where's now the torturing pain?
'Tis hollow, and resteth never.
'Tis in the evening first our home we prize—
'Tis lifeless, magical, a shape of air,
'Tis long since thou hast been either to shrift or mass.
'Tis not amiss thus through the world to sweep;
'Tis quite a little Paris; people there
'Tis really shameful, I declare,
'Tis shiver'd! 'tis shatter'd!
'Tis some illusion doth your sight deceive.
'Tis sorcery, I vow!
'Tis still the fashion as it used to be,
'Tis thine our course to steer.
'Tis thou thyself! I scarce believe it yet.
'Tis thou! O say so once again! (embracing him.)
'Tis thou! To save me thou art come!
'Tis training.—nothing more.
'Tis true I've more cunning than all your dull tribe,
'Tis true: Sybilla told me so to-day!
'Tis usual here that number to present.
'Tis very wonderful! What's in it I can't guess;
'Tis well enough to try it if you will;
'Tis well! I oft have envied you indeed,
'Tis well! I'm always loath to go,
'Tis well,
'Tis what you ask'd me for, at least!
'Tis when the roof rings back the tone,
'Tis wretched to beg, as I must do,
'Tis wretched, in foreign lands to stray.
'Tis writ, "In the beginning was the Word!"
'Tis yet too soon.
'Twas all delusion, cheat and lie.
'Twas fate's decree!
'Twas not toy purpose thee to lime;
'Twas straw half rotten; yet, he as a Christian died.
'Twas thy dishonour pierced my heart,
'Twas well it was not grey, let that suffice.
'Twas wine I drank, most certainly.
'Twas wisely done, however, to repair
'Twill crumble away;
'Twill interest wheresoever seiz'd and shown;
'Twill serve whereon through air to ride,
'Twould injure me in company, and hence,

(The WITCH dissolves the circle. FAUST steps Out.)
(The WITCH, with extraordinary gestures, describes a circle, and places strange things within it. The glasses meanwhile begin to ring, the caldron to sound, and to make music. Lastly, she brings a great book; places the MONKEYS in the circle to serve her as a desk, and to hold the torches. She beckons FAUST to approach.)
(The WITCH, with great emphasis, begins to declaim the book.)
(The WITCH, with many ceremonies, pours the liquor into a cup; as FAUST lifts it to his mouth, a light flame arises.)

A bachelor's conversion's hard, indeed!
A balsam yet devis'd of any kind?
A book with seven seals, close-fasten'd, are;
A broomstick dost thou not at least desire?
A brute!
A central peak have reached, which shows,
A chain at first, pearl ear-drops then,—your mother
A chain of wondrous agency,
A chair! I'm fainting! All things swim!
A child so worthy to be loved.
A cock's gay feather for a plume,
A comely maid took pity on my friend;
A constant weaving
A cordial, and your heart inspire!
A cross upon his breast.
A cry of murder strikes upon the ear;
A custom 'tis of ancient date,
A dainty gentleman, no doubt of it.
A damsel leads thee by the nose!
A depth below or height above.
A devil's pluck thou'rt wont to show;
A dilettante did the piece invent,
A dog dost see, no spectre have we here;
A dog well taught
A face like that I never saw before!
A faculty I pray you name.
A failure now, with words now fitly mated,
A favour claims return as this world goes.
A fear unwonted o'er my spirit falls;
A few steps further, up to yonder stone!
A fine exploit it is no doubt.
A finish'd whole what boots it to present!
A fit occasion but to find.
A flame is kindled in my breast!
A formal deed, with seal and signature,
A fortnight's space, at least, I need,
A friend!
A gallant friend I have, not far from here,
A gallant show displaying.
A game thou hast, at which none win who play,
A garter bring me,—any thing!
A girl who would, with amorous eyen,
A glass to freedom I would gladly drain.
A glimpse of them the mother caught,
A glowing life—
A golden beaker gave.
A golden chain no more thou'lt wear!
A good man in his darkest aberration,
A good night to her, from his hairy throat!
A goodly ship is every trough;
A goodly sow and mother thereon,
A growing mind alone will grateful prove.
A hair's breadth is not added to my height,
A heavenly oracle! He loveth thee!
A high vaulted narrow Gothic chamber.
A highly learned man like you,
A house and garden near the city-wall.
A hundred fires in rows disperse the gloom;
A hundred thousand fools or more,
A husband you deserve this very day;
A joy that must eternal prove!
A kerchief from her snowy breast,
A king there was once reigning,
A king there was once reigning,
A knock? Come in! Who now would break my rest?
A large caldron hangs over the fire on a low hearth; various figures appear in the vapour rising from it. A FEMALE MONKEY sits beside the caldron to skim it, and watch that it does not boil over. The MALE MONKEY with the young ones is seated near, warming himself. The walls and ceiling are adorned with the strangest articles of witch-furniture.
A light the darkness doth dispel.
A limitless ocean,
A line of fire upon his track to leave.
A line or two in writing grant, I pray.
A little gas, which I will soon prepare,
A little liberty and careless ease.
A long and pointed rapier, too;
A lover at thy feet bends low,
A lurid light, like dawn's red glow,
A magic mantle did I but possess,
A maid, as my dear Gretchen fair,
A maiden never more.
A man like other men you see;
A man to know and hear, whose name
A man's success, his rise secures.
A means to improve or convert mankind.
A merry club assembles there.
A model which all women shall surpass,
A moral song shall charm her ear,
A murky vapour thickens night.
A mystery remains alike to fools and sages.
A narrow compass limits her desires,
A new-born impulse wings my flight,
A noble youth, far travelled, he
A nosegay may that be?
A part of darkness, which gave birth to light,
A place of torment this indeed!
A pleasant thing has no one found.
A poet choose as your ally!
A precious life, thyself to bore,
A pregnant utterance or two!
A pretty play our leisure to beguile!
A proper lad of genuine flesh and blood,
A proper man I dash away,
A quiet spirit worketh whole years long;
A rag for a sail does well enough;
A rapture I never again shall prove;
A rare, sweet pastime. Verily!
A ray of truth through error gleaming,
A restless heaving,
A ruddy lion there, a suitor bold,
A scrap is for our compact good.
A serious tone you hardly dare employ.
A show they want, they come to gape and stare.
A shuddering horror floats,
A single moment will we not delay,
A smoke-stained paper doth enfold;
A soldier's figure, with companions bold;
A solemn festive greeting, to the coming day!
A something warns me, once more to efface.
A song offensive! Thank God, every morn
A soulless groveller should banish thus!
A sounding phrase will serve you in good stead.
A spectre this from which all shrink afraid.
A spell of fear
A sprightly fellow's presence at your play,
A strange oppression both of head and heart.
A string of pearls to grace her neck.
A thousand bridges I could build meanwhile.
A thousand germs burst forth spontaneously;
A thousand knots one stroke combines.
A toad in form and feature;
A touch of thievish joy and wantonness.
A traveller from complaisance,
A travelling scholar? Why I needs must smile.
A truce to words, mere empty sound,
A true witch-element!
A very lumber-room, a rubbish-hole;
A very poodle, he appears to be!
A walk to Wasserhof were best.
A welcome guest, if thou'lt be still.
A wider circle he desires,
A witches' pack.
A wondrous show! but ah! a show alone!
A word comes opportunely into play
A worthy object still pursue!
A writing, Pedant! dost demand from me?
A yearning impulse, undefin'd yet dear,
A yearning long unfelt, each impulse swaying,
A young man then, each house you sought,
A! tara lara da!
A! tara lara da!

AUERBACH'S CELLAR IN LEIPZIG
AUTHOR
Abash'd before him I appear,
Ablaze, in all their towering height!
About posterity were I to prate,
Above the mist, the other doth aspire,
Abroad I roam.
Abroad our mothers ne'er would let us stir.
Abroad to waft me as on viewless wings,
Absorb'd in thought, here oft I sat alone,
Abstain,
Accomplishes no wish of mine—not one.
Accords not thy growl, thy bestial din.
Accurs'd be hope! accurs'd be faith!
Accurs'd be mammon, when with treasure
Accurs'd love's dream, of joys the first!
Accurs'd of dreams the treacherous wiles,
Accurs'd what each as property beguiles,
Accursed brute to scorch the dame!
Accursed brute! accursed SOW!
Accursed mob! How dare ye thus to meet?
Accursed rat-catchers, your strains I'll end!
Acquire a certain easy finish'd air.
Action, and the joys of sense!
Actors unpaid their service bringing.
Adam's first wife. Of her rich locks beware!
Adown the cliffs the silvery fountains leap:
After dame Martha Schwerdtlein I inquire!
After my father's death it saw the day;
After those servant girls forsooth, to run.
After to-morrow it returns,
Afterwards MEPHISTOPHELES.
Again at eighty to grow hale and young.
Again hast played the spy?
Again would I,
Against my will!
Against the rocks' deep base are hurled;
Against your plan I must at once protest.
Age does not make us childish, as folk say,
Ah God! what hast thou done?
Ah I now I know thee, sure enough!
Ah haste! For if thou still delayest,
Ah no,
Ah! Him on earth we miss;
Ah! ah! that would indeed be making free
Ah! at this spectacle through every sense,
Ah! for the very fount of life.
Ah! rich in sorrow, thou,
Ah! she forebodes not that her lover's near,
Ah! the remembrance is my death,
Ah! those were happy times, I wis!
Ah! we must needs bemoan.
Ah! when the friendly taper gloweth,
Ah! you mistake!
Ah, could I but thy soul inspire!
Ah, could I clasp
Ah, if I slept alone! To-night
Ah, in the very middle of her lay,
Ah, little rogue, so thou
Ah, rich in sorrow, thou,
Ah, sir, thus living, it must be confess'd
Ah, when will meekness and humility,
Ah, wheresoe'er I go,
Ah, who can know
Air! light!
Alas!
Alas!
Alas! If I remain not rooted to this place,
Alas! That men should thus be doomed to woe!
Alas! Where we laid Him,
Alas! good Martha! don't despair!
Alas! ill-fortune leads me here,
Alas! it long bath sorely troubled me,
Alas! my heart is breaking!
Alas! our every deed, as well as every woe,
Alas! that when on spirit-wing we rise,
Alas, I might search far and near,
Alas, for myself!
Alas, thought I, he doubtless in thy mien,
Alive he shall not leave this spot!
All awake, around, above?

All good and fair!
All had gone swimmingly, no doubt,
All heaven itself descends upon the soul.
All in the cool shade!
All innocence her virgin soul,
All lawless promptings, deeds unholy,
All lifeward tending, upward still wending,
All now have come forth into the light.
All things investing with hues of life:
All things round us whirl and fly;
All things. Alas, we poor!
All this is doubtless good and fair;
All to his heir resigning,
All's to my gentleman child's play!
All-sustainer,
Almighty God! I am undone!
Almost creative bliss
Almost the same the parson says,
Aloft strange voices dost thou hear?
Aloft to yonder spheres I dare not soar,
Aloft to you we would mount with glee!
Alone is the essential.
Alone old Baubo's coming now;
Alone thine image fills her heart,
Along the labyrinth of these vales to creep,
Along the loved one's path would strow?
Already I have done so much for thee,
Already I know much, but would know everything.
Already fire and eddying smoke I view;
Already freed, with eager joy who hail'd
Already now the street I see
Already the others are far away!
Already these ten years I lead,
Already they have bravely danced and sprung!
Already thou'rt again outworn,
Already, whirl'd so far away!
Although so young and tender.
Am I a God? What light intense!
Am I once more deluded! must I deem
Am I with thee my room to share,
Amidst all the howling of hell's fiery flood,
Among heaven's choicest gifts, I place,
Among the groups parading!
An Ignis Fatuus I must call instead.
An actor, oft I've heard it said, as teacher,
An all-sufficient guide? Thou'lt see
An ancient ballad endeth so;
An angel, sweet, if it resembled thee!
An hour.
An idol. Such to meet with, bodes no good;
An inward impulse hurries him afar,
An odd sort of a guest he needs must be.
An ugly song! a song political!
Ancient the art and modern too, my friend.
And 'gan with secret fear to groan.
And 'mong the elves be Puck to-day,
And 'mong the witches gather'd here
And 'tis a true romance ere one's aware.
And Gretchen!
And I am sav'd!—
And I could weep hot tears, to see the sun
And I must cook, sew, knit, and Sweep,
And Kobold shall slave.
And Seeming's changeful forms, around you flowing,
And after, ever after him to strive!
And ah—his kiss!
And all his poor relations
And all look forward to a festal treat.
And all that's near, and all that's far,
And all the skirts were swinging.
And all things that belong thereto,
And all things touch'd by those sweet lips of hers,
And all this misery, this bitter need,
And all thy works, sublime, eternal,
And all to her seems flat and tame;
And also power to feel her and enjoy;
And apes', if such your appetite;
And art thou he? and art thou really he?
And as he can he fareth.
And as he loves his head, to make
And at her feet sink down with shame.
And beaming tenderly with looks of love,
And bore and cherished? which, with ecstasy,
And brawls of a prime sort.
And bread, too, in the very widest sense;
And brides so unaffected!
And briefly I would counsel you
And bring fresh jewels instantly!
And but for me, be well assured,
And by a mystic impulse, to my soul,
And by the master's words to swear alone.
And call it pleasure, call it song.
And call the glow, wherewith I burn,
And can she, by these rites abhorred,
And cannot choose but vex me;
And carry on the poet's avocation,
And closely in your manual look,
And closely-cleaving organs, still adheres;
And clust'ring grapes too, close at hand!
And crack without delay.
And danger in a thousand forms prepare!
And dar'st thou not call him so?
And dare a voice of merely human birth,
And dead men's bones in smoke and mould.
And did myself securely bless—
And dilettanti will enact it too.
And disciplin'd myself with prayer and fast.
And dost in silent grove, in air and stream
And dost thou ask why heaves thy heart,
And dost thou know, love, whom thou wouldst set free?
And doubtless was of high degree:
And e'en though God thy crime forgive,
And each aloft his bonnet throws,
And even my own head almost begins to reel.
And every bud sweet promise made,
And fan your ash-heaps into flame!
And fling the trade in empty words away.
And fold him here!
And fond remembrance now doth me, with childlike feeling,
And for another lover meanwhile would look out.
And for my frenzy finding no fit name,
And for the town, what doth he do for it?
And for thy stick will into water spring.
And forth into the world with me!
And from my heart.
And from the churches' awe-breathing night,
And from the earth craves every highest good,
And from the house goes every one content.
And from the linden, far and wide, Juchhe! Juchhe!
And from the small and well-conn'd book
And furtively abroad they spread.
And gave such tokens of her love and care,
And greatly they were edified.
And green of life the golden tree.
And had you naught besides to bring?
And haply, ere one half the course is run,
And has repented after!
And hath a tongue wherewith his point to gain,
And head and heart are also thine;
And heart to heart, and soul to soul be pressed?
And hence I cannot your repugnance blame.
And here
And here I stand, with all my lore,
And him the North Pole under.
And hope, before my final step indeed,
And how by method all things to reduce.
And how it fares with us, to ask art fain,
And how must I thy services repay?
And if he is, what matters it to me!
And if my end I finally should gain,
And if my senses are not gone,
And if there be in yonder spheres
And if there were no first and second,
And if this world I must forego,
And if to help me you decline,
And if to pleasure thee I aught can do,
And if to show the path you choose a meteor's light,
And if with me united,
And in enjoyment languish for desire. (MEPHISTOPHELES
And in her honour drain'd his glass;
And in the feeling when thou utterly art blest,
And in the grass its ancient ditty sings.
And in the twilight wandered, sorely vexed?
And in these halls, with benches filled, distraught,
And in white sheet do penance now!
And into ruin let her plunge with me!
And introducing you as my good friend,
And is as wondrous now as on the primal day.
And jogg'd her with his elbow;
And just because my cask begins to fail,
And justly; for whate'er to light is brought
And labours on, because she must.
And lead him on thy downward course,
And leave me on the straw at home.
And left in pledge for loan my mother lent.
And lisp like angels, to betray.
And look, my hand doth thine enclose!
And love to God the soul inspires.
And love-sick evermore.
And loved besides the dice accurs'd.
And make all ready for our pleasant trip!
And malice ill-conceal'd;
And many a useless instrument,
And mark with pitying eye my misery!
And mark with pitying eye my misery!
And mark yon rocky walls that stand
And me they will catch, do what I may.
And mid the crashing shipwreck not despair.
And mine she show'd me also in the glass,
And more than all, be patience curs'd!
And much, sir, may the liquor profit you!
And must I really then take leave of you? Farewell!
And must a promise hold me fast?
And must again the genuine devil play.
And must so early die!
And names the dear ones, they whom Fate bereaving
And never again drank he.
And never yet a surfeit known.
And nevermore!
And nevermore!
And nevermore.
And next, before aught else you learn,
And nine is one,
And none would of their faith or church bereave.
And not a trinket? not a ring?
And not one step beyond!—
And not rank with thee! (A knock.)
And not to break with him am always civil;
And not to death shouldst go.
And now I—I could tear out my hair,
And now, they say that I my child have slain.
And now—
And of the treasure I received my due."
And often as he drained it,
And old ones, veil'd more prudently.
And on his kisses
And our young couple?
And over moor and lake, the crane
And peaceful times we bless, peace long-abiding.
And pearls of price, so says the proverb old.
And pledging you, I pray aloud,
And plunge him in a sea of dreams!
And plunging hi the sea;
And praise sounds half like pity too.
And prey, with parching breath, upon thy lungs;
And prove to you, it must be so;
And quaff'd his last life's glow,
And raging form, without cessation,
And rather hungers, rather begs than spend!
And render into my loved German tongue.
And round about the linden-trees,
And round the walls doth slyly creep;
And say to all things only, yes.
And scandal's busy still, do whatsoe'er one may.
And scented in the jewels rare,
And see, deep sinking in the tide,
And seems with shackled feet to move along;
And seizes me!
And shall I see her ?—Have her?
And share at length with them the shipwreck of mankind.
And she to him. 'Tis of the world the way!
And should this last, thou wilt be torn
And shun thy hated form to meet,
And sitting aloft is Sir Urial seen:
And smiling, nestled in my bosom too.
And so existence is to me a weight.
And so much hidden poison lies therein,
And so, I trust, when comes the final wreck,
And some few youngsters evermore!
And soon with ecstasy thou'lt recognise
And sooner done the deed.
And sooth to say, II like her well.
And sorely hath remorse his conscience wrung.
And spare my lungs; who would the right maintain,
And stiff-silk mantle richly dress'd,
And still my heart doth close when he comes near.
And still the progress of his beams they check;
And straight a bumper for him pour!
And strove to make it blacker than before.
And sure, he godless cannot be,
And swathed him with care;
And sweat each casual word to hear!
And talk about it more anon!
And taxes more than ever pay.
And tempests roar in emulation
And ten is none,
And the cliffs with lowly greeting;
And the danger to which thou dust expose thyself? Know, the guilt of blood, shed by thy hand, lies yet upon the town. Over the place where fell the murdered one, avenging spirits hover and watch for the returning murderer.
And the fire-flies' glittering throng,
And the little one place on my right breast.
And the mysterious veil of night
And the young monkey for her love reward.
And then before the mirror walk an hour or so,
And then of humankind and beasts, brood,—
And then the lofty intuition—.
And then the virgin flower was gone.
And then this pot?
And then we girls would plague her too,
And there antagonists compel,
And they grew red, and they grew warm,
And things—magnificent they are,
And think they're near the treasure,
And this flower-language, darling, let it be,
And this young lady, we shall find her too?
And thou didst save me ere I sank dismay'd,
And thou dost spurn me, and back retreat—
And thou to them must see
And thou wilt take me to thine arms again.
And thou! ah here what seekest thou?
And though I smash'd them one and all,—
And though not fairer to behold,
And through heaven's narrow portal forceful presses;
And thus the child became as 'twere roy own;
And thus thine eloquence inflame?
And thus to theirs dilate my individual mind,
And thy heart
And time be never more for me!
And to a cubit's height upraise thy socks,
And to a lonely grave as bachelor to creep,
And to and fro she shakes her head;
And to my cost Theology,
And to the very brim the goblet crown!
And treasures buried long ago;
And trees, whose verdure daily buds anew!
And trust he'll profit much thereby!
And underneath the spreading leaves,
And visions fair of many a blissful day;
And wags his tail—as dogs are wont to do.
And wait as on an oracle; while they,
And walls high in air,
And watch adown the stream the painted vessels gliding,
And weave the life-garment of deity.
And well-nigh petrifies his heart to stone:—
And were he not the devil's by his bond,
And what a glorious height we have achieved at last.
And what he knoweth, that he cannot use.
And what the dainty spirits sing,
And what the spirit of the times men call,
And what thou ne'er shall lose, o'er that dost shed the tear.
And what we ought not, that to do were fair;
And what you wish, that I could help you to.
And when a dozen thee have known,
And when at length from studious toil I rest,
And when in earnest you are moved to speak,
And when the goods of this world are achiev'd,
And when the topmost peak we round,
And when with soothing beam, the moon's pale orb
And whether pious in the good old way;
And which, alas, our whole life long,
And while their host will credit give,
And while youth's passions are aflame
And whirling on, the magic choir
And who proclaim,
And whose precipitate endeavour
And wild confusion round them see—
And with an evil conscience thereto!
And with considerate speed, through fancy's spell,
And with delusive flattery bindeth
And with reason is fraught!
And with the spheres, both rock and ocean
And with your likeness to the gods, poor fool,
And with your pleasures what have I to do?
And yet can ne'er the summit gain!
And yet his will I ne'er did thwart,
And yet my steps I would retrace.
And yet shrink back afraid of fire?
And yet significant and pleasing too?
And yet they dared not scratch them,
And yet, methinks, by most 'twill be confess'd
And yet, with this sweet strain familiar when a boy,
And you?
And your two ravens, where are they?
And, as for bread in famine, at the baker's door,
And, dancing it, must pace the chamber to and fro;
And, for Heaven's sake, 'tis not his way
And, free from trammels, speed away,
And, if I err not, he appears to me
And, like snakes, the roots of trees
And, purged from knowledge-fumes, renew
And, still to mock his greedy haste,
And, to say truth, as yet with small success.
Anear, like showers of golden sand
Anew created,
Announce the solemn dawn of Easter-day?
Anon she tranquil is, or so appears,
Anon to drown thyself and field and plain.
Another a wild night in wanton joy would spend.
Another bite—so—now 'tis done—
Another case, of ebony.
Another chorus now succeeds,
Another dance begins; we'll join it, come away!
Another may arise the void to fill.
Another moment prithee here remain,
Another quick'ning pulse, that even now
Another set without delay!
Appalling dreams my soul affright;
Apples still fondly ye desire,
Apt scholar of the students, 'tis his due!
Are craving for illusion still!
Are distraught.
Are dull as wetted straw to-day.
Are fair as on the primal day.
Are fair as on the primal day.
Are fill'd with light elysian;
Are huge substantial masses.
Are nature's laws suspended here?
Are no fantastic sorcery.
Are not things worse from day to day?
Are sketches unpretending;
Are they not thronging on thy heart and brain,
Are unrefreshing as the empty wind,
Are we compelled to leave full many a spot,
Are we the sport of every passing gale?
Are wondrous and exceeding rare!
Ariel wakes his dainty air,
Around that lovely neck its coil entwine,
Around thee weaving their mysterious chain?
Around whose narrow jaws rolleth hell's fiery flood;
Arrayed in flesh and blood,
Art hovering near!
Art lucky to have seen it; now,
Art not discreet enough, I trow,
Art thou he? Thou,—who by my breath art blighted,
Art thou, comrade fell,
As Germany's Parnassus.
As Orpheus' lyre the beasts, so now
As all too plainly it doth appear,
As at a feast, to show them by degrees:
As at the Holy Ghost's dictation!
As dagger, poison, fire and flood;
As devil or as wizard to appear?
As did my cousin, the renowned snake.
As dilettante to uplift the curtain.
As draw an infant's tooth. I've not a doubt
As each to other passed the generous cheer.
As easily I'll worm their secret out,
As eating and as drinking free,
As erst upon my troubled sight ye stole;
As for a devil who despairs,
As for my bet no fears I entertain.
As for the foot, with which I can't dispense,
As for the law born with us, unexpressed;—
As for the rising generation, ne'er
As gathering darkness doth around it close!
As he in his old mill, then doubtless he
As heaven may please.
As his loath'd visage, in my life before,
As his own son were he!
As if a mill-wheel there were turning round.
As if before you stood,
As if his frame love wasted.
As if his frame love wasted.
As if his frame love wasted.
As if his frame love wasted.
As if his frame love wasted.
As if his frame love wasted.
As if of nuts it were a basket.
As if the choir
As in Italian story oft is told.
As in the bosom of a friend to gaze.
As in the earth, in water, and in air,
As it seems, we now are speeding;
As many as you will.
As much as of Herr Schwerdtlein's death you know!
As my peculiar element I claim.
As not improbably may come to pass.
As o'er the lofty city-walls they fly,
As on the Prater all is gay,
As soldier is my brother gone;
As spirit doth with spirit speak!
As that of Doctor Luther,
As their two dozen legs were mine indeed.
As they were mushrooms; and the casket,
As thou wouldst stifle me thou then didst kiss!—
As thou, without, didst please and amuse me
As though the Host came by, would bend the knee.
As through the vales, with blooms inlaid,
As to a masquerade, with absent minds, they press,
As to our booth the living tide progresses;
As upward from the vapoury mist ye roll;
As wave on wave successive rolls along,
As when a corpse infects the street.
As when at first around, above,
As when, 'mid forest gloom, reigneth the moon's soft light?
As with a mother's voice it prompteth thee,
As works the draught, thou presently shalt greet
As would you to the lecture-room repair,
Ascend not to the ceiling! Come,
Ascends thy piteous sigh,
Assume a decent tone of courteous ease,
At Padua, in St. Anthony's,
At a royal feast sat he,
At best a sort of mock-heroic play,
At court were sore distressed;
At dawn of day
At dawn to deck thy shrine!
At every feast he drained it,
At homage paid thee by this crowd! Thrice blest
At home one surely has enough of quiet.
At night its little cradle stood
At night, when at our wheels we sat,
At once it scatters, far and wide;
At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we manage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly from Michael Hart's salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an assortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few more years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we don't want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.
At present you've distinguished company.
At sight of him strange horror o'er me steal;
At the first glance we fly it in dismay;
At thine inaugural feast I will this day
At this poor Gretchen 'gan to pout;
At thy good pleasure, visit me.
At whose aspect the Spirit wings its flight!
Attend, my duties to commence.—
Attend, of brutishness ere long
Aught thou mayst lose, again he'll bring,
Author: Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe
Away forthwith, and to the fields repair,
Away from thee!
Away! (Exeunt.)
Away! I will return no more!
Away, thou fool! Her torment ease!
Ay truly! even to the loftiest star!
Ay truly! that is just the proper tone!
Ay! and full many a riddle tied anew.
Ay! and his evil plight bewail'd still more.
Ay! what 'mong men as knowledge doth obtain!
Ay, if one did not take a somewhat deeper view!
Ay, if the grave's without,—
Ay, if your priest should be an actor too,
Ay, it is late, good sir.
Ay, madam, what two witnesses declare
Ay, neighbour! So let matters stand for me!
Ay, out of sight is out of mind!
Ay, sing, sing on, praise her with all, thy might!!
Ay, sir! Most gladly I'll obey.
Ay, to your favour he's entitled too,
Ay, truly! 'tis well done, that you
Ay, verily! a corpse's eyes are those,

BURGHER'S DAUGHTER
Back from the last, the solemn step, withhold.
Back it recalleth me to life once more.
Back o'er life's devious labyrinthine way,
Back on humanity's uncertain fate!
Back to the town direct thy sight.
Bars not my godlike progress. Lo, the ocean,
Bathed in the deathless evening-beams,
Be civil at least!
Be kind enough to show us up the height!
Be lavish of the stellar lights,
Be merciful, and let me live!
Be not a hollow tinkling fool!
Be not afraid that I shall break my word!
Be only self-possessed, and thou hast learn'd to live.
Be pleas'd to listen to my prayer,
Be prompt, and do as I direct.
Be still! The bitterns 'mong the reeds
Be this our wager!
Bear us from book to book, from page to page!
Bear, lady nightingale above,
Because I coarseness hate of every sort.
Because I've no resource, thou'rt in the right.
Because my sire ye served, now dead and gone.
Bedizen'd o'er with ribbons,
Before aught else, this jovial crew,
Before life's joys our grasp elude.
Before me thou dost lead her living tribes,
Before which incline
Before your lover's door?
Begin to delve, to cultivate the ground,
Begone and leave me, I entreat!
Behind him still advancing.
Behind the stove now quietly lay thee,
Behind the stove, tam'd by my spells,
Behold the yonker dressed;
Behold us at your revel!
Bend, beauteous light!
Beneath Heaven's sunshine, everywhere,
Beneath the floor,
Beneficence becomes a pest;
Beside this desk, at dead of night,
Besides, he is a man of many a grade,
Besides, he's off.
Besides, when he is near, I ne'er could pray.
Better he might have fared, poor wight,
Better my little means hath squandered quite away,
Beware!
Bewilder'd, he shall falter, and stick fast;
Birth and the grave
Black as it seemed, I blacken'd it still more,
Blessed the loving one,
Blood is a juice of very special kind.
Bloometh the grove!
Bold is the venture,
Bold is the venture,
Boldly to sweep, with graceful cunning,
Both great and small send up a cheer;
Brass, marble, parchment, paper, dost desire?
Bravo! I find you all aflame!
Bravo! That's the song for me!
Breathing of order and abounding grace.
Bright pictures, but obscure their meaning:
Bring Fancy with her choral trains before us,
Bring cotton-wool! He splits my ears.
Bring much, you something bring for various classes,
Brood o'er your task! Together glue,
Brook and brooklet haste below;
Broom and pitch-fork, goat and prong,
Brute skeletons surround thee here,
Build it once more!
But 'tis a wicked place, just here about;
But 'tis my will
But 'tis our inborn impulse, deep and strong,
But I perceive no cloven foot.
But I would go through all again with joy,
But I'm prepar'd my travels to pursue,
But ah! Despite my will, it stands confessed,
But ah, the evil days come round!
But as a leech, her hocus-pocus plays,
But as it was it pleased me too.
But as regards this science, you will find
But as to-morrow will be Easter-day,
But be it a brand new one, if you please!
But be thine art a pleasant one!
But before all strive this half year
But before long, its eager thirst
But child is child, and play is play.
But come, of gossip I am weary quite;
But dimly through the painted glass!
But do not fret, I pray; why seek
But ere you leave us, quickly tell!
But fairly quiet now my days, I own;
But for a poodle, whom his instinct serves
But for the very oldest let me ask;
But from the harmony that, gushing from his soul,
But from us she something would request.
But gain no elevation.
But gaping watch their neighbours, who goes in and out;
But he his gold not lavishly bath spent.
But he will surely marry her?
But hence!—A mighty grief I trow!
But here I longed true knowledge to attain.
But how are we to start, I pray?
But how shall we begin?
But impulse such as this I ne'er have known:
But in another book the lesson's writ;—
But in her atmosphere alone,
But in my pockets, I have nothing there.
But let not moody thoughts their shadow throw
But let the great world rave and riot!
But let them hasten as they can,
But let us hence! Grey eve doth all things blend,
But little fails and they to thee,
But long this mood thou'lt not retain.
But many weary hours, in sooth, were also mine.
But may you wither soon, my dear,
But not too far away!
But now at length the god appears to sink;
But now, without offence or jest!
But one thing puzzles me, my friend;
But one thing!—Accidents may happen, hence
But people from the change have nothing won.
But quarter of an hour; meanwhile equip,
But quick, away! We must at once take wing;
But recently I've quitted home,
But recently returned from Spain are we,
But small concern I feel for yonder world;
But soon, full grown, she waxes bold,
But still unscath'd you issued thence.
But such arrangements time require;
But take heed!
But that this charm be rent, the threshold passed,
But that thy brain, like mine, of old perplexed,
But that which issues from the heart alone,
But the familiar chords among
But the sun endureth no trace of white;
But then appalling the amount they've read..
But then away again to something new!
But then my mother's sleep is light,
But then some meaning must the words convey.
But then the world and man, his heart and brain!
But then, alas, none cares for you,
But this I know—that you are very kind.
But to new horror I awake each morn,
But two alone wear powder!
But what must now mine eyes behold!
But when together yonder we appear,
But wherefore to yon Spot is riveted my gaze?
But why the charming damsel leave, I pray,
But why? what mischief hath it done?
But with the blood-ban 'tis another thing.
But with the grapes how was it, pray?
But ye, the genuine sons of heaven, rejoice!
But yet the draught the devil can't prepare.
But yet without desire;
But, Lord, Thy servants are revering
But, my good friend, a season will come round,
But, who, I wonder, could the caskets bring? I fear there's something wrong about the thing! (a knock,)
By Nostradamus' proper hand,
By a new track through ether's wide dominion,
By a thousand steps they take the lead.
By accident thou thus art caught!
By all rejected love! By hellish fire I curse,
By deeds that love reveal,
By frenzy or remorse and pain.
By heaven! This girl is fair indeed!
By mass alone can you subdue the masses,
By means of three and one, and one and three.
By our own choice ourselves to isolate!
By pious people, it is true,
By something clever doubtless should be crown'd.
By stealth thou dost begin with one,
By storm we cannot take the fort,
By the time that Goethe was twenty, the Faust legend had fascinated his imagination; for three years before he went to Weimar he had been working on scattered scenes and bits of dialogue; and though he suspended actual composition on it during three distinct periods, it was always to resume, and he closed his labors upon it only with his life. Thus the period of time between his first experiments and the final touches is more than sixty years. During this period the plans for the structure and the signification of the work inevitably underwent profound modifications, and these have naturally affected the unity of the result; but, on the other hand, this long companionship and persistent recurrence to the task from youth to old age have made it in a unique way the record of Goethe's personality in all its richness and diversity.
By this road from our goal we're still far wide.
By torture driven, in open day,
By use to render it thine own!
By which thy life-pulse is oppress'd?
By which we to the fountains rise!

Climb not the everlasting stars on high?
Climbing the steep hill's side,
Cling to these ancient ribs of granite rock,
Cling! Clang! so rang the jovial sound!
Close at her side my brother,
Close to my bed; so was I wide awake
Clouds gather over me—
Coarse beggar's gruel here we stew.
Coil themselves from rock and sand,
Com'st hopping forth already! Now
Come forth and gnaw the threshold here,
Come hither, Sirrah! join our company!
Come in!
Come in!
Come in! come in!
Come in! tread softly! be discreet!
Come o'er me in the Sabbath's stilly hour,
Come often over here to me,
Come then, ascend yon little hill!
Come then, employ your lofty inspiration,
Come thou with me!
Come with us, come with us from Felsensee.
Come ye a dweller in the dust to seek?
Come! Follow me, my dearest love, be bold!
Come! come away!
Come! come! already night begins to wane.
Come! look me in the face! no fooling now!
Come, Agatha! I care not to be seen
Come, brew me such without delay!
Come, brother, we will follow them anon.
Come, come along with me! we'll slip in there.
Come, come! With her I'll else abandon thee!
Come, quick, and let thyself be led by me;
Comes floating towards me I I'm prepar'd to fly
Command my humble service when you choose.
Commands thy presence; without fear
Communion high with her to hold,
Comrade so noisy, ever growling,
Conceal the surging concourse, I implore thee,
Conduct me to her place of rest!
Confer on you one obligation more.
Confess, sirs, I know how to live:
Confound your gasconading!
Consider! 'tis soft wood you have to split;
Content and order brood around.
Contention now suspended.
Contentment welleth up no longer in my breast.
Contesting space and ancient rank with night.
Conventicles, and not a few,
Convey me thither! She shall be free!

Dame Martha!
Damsel and fortress
Damsel disdainful,
Dance and song
Dancers are springing;
Dancingly play.
Dare with determin'd will to burst the portals
Dark clouds that o'er us spread,
Dash! Smash!
Daughters, can ill-got wealth digest."
Dawn on another day, whose round forlorn
Day dawns! My love! My love!
Dazzling meteors change their places,
Dear Gretchen, more collected be!
Dear angel! there's no cause for dread.
Dear hand! so godlike in its ministry!
Dear son, beware!
Dear soul! I've long forgiven him, indeed!
Dearest of men! I love thee from my heart!
Death fondly I desire, and life I hate.
Death is in every word.
Dedication
Deep in my heart is stamp'd for aye;
Deep in my soul can stir the springs;
Deluded fool! 'Tis magic, I declare! To each she doth his lov'd one's image wear.
Delusion, from their eyes the bandage take!
Depart! elsewhere another servant choose
Depicted in the swollen creature.
Deserves again to be reduced to naught;
Despair the power of sense did well-nigh blast,
Despite my length of beard I need
Despite the efforts of my will.
Destruction, Sin, or briefly, Evil, name,
Devil alliterates with doubt,
Did it not happen that myself am he!
Did you not see it? I cast down my eyes.
Did you with Master Hans there chance to sup?
Didst lisp thy prayer,
Dies irae, dies illa,
Digests the ancient leaven! Know, this Whole
Dispersed the throng, their severed flight now winging;
Dissolv'd in bliss, in love's delicious bower!
Distant now and now more near?
Do I a magic atmosphere inhale?
Do I not ever feel her woe?
Do I not own their strength and speed?
Do we not gaze into each other's eyes?
Do ye arrest, in ever-during thought!
Do you ask?
Doctor, 'tis really kind of you,
Doctor, stand fast! your strength collect!
Does my cock's feather no allegiance claim?
Does nothing on the earth to thee seem right?
Don't be so rude, good fellow!
Don't make so free! How many a maid
Don't stamp so heavily, I pray;
Dost claim this holocaust, remorseless Hell!
Dost comprehend what bliss without alloy
Dost know him the thief,
Dost know me! Skeleton! Vile scarecrow, thou!
Dost make no question of my gentle blood;
Dost mark how round us, with wide spiral curves,
Dost promise that in this foul nest
Dost suck, like any toad, thy food?
Dost the creative power resist,
Dost there reveal me to myself, and show
Dost thou believe in God?
Doth ever in the prayer-book snuff;
Doth for the Deity alone subsist!
Doth knowledge loathe of every kind.
Doth not Sir Mammon for this fete
Doth not in truth act well by me!
Doth not the firm-set earth beneath us lie?
Doth not the world in all its currents rave,
Double its strength with years doth grow.
Doubtless the purest happiness was thine.
Down from the vaulted roof
Down from thine old receptacle I draw!
Down sink the bending grasses.
Draws back into his heart the wondrous whole?
Dreadful shape!
Drew me from harrowing thought's bewild'ring maze,
Drifting cloud and misty wreathes
Drive to the devil, thou hellish pest!
Drop out the four!
Drove me to wander on through wood and field;
Dust he shall eat, ay, and with relish take,
E'en by the wisest of us may be sought.
E'en from my breast, a neighbour snare,
E'en from yon far hill's path-worn side,
E'en hell hath its peculiar laws, I see!
E'en here, where shapes immortal throng'd, intrude?
E'en now I glow as with new wine;
E'en now my strength is rising higher,
E'en the late pine-grove feels her quickening powers;
E'en the presentiment of every joy,
E'en their applause is to my heart a pang;
E'en though he had them by the very throat!
E'en to the noblest by the soul conceiv'd,

Each good and noble quality,
Each in his language doth the like impart;
Each lives it, not to many is it known,
Each man learns only that which learn he can;
Each may his own selection make.
Each named with pride his favourite lass,
Each nobler aim is termed a cheat, a lie.
Each on his own small round intent,
Each other have not seen for many a day.
Each sees the working of his heart laid bare.
Each sense, with eager palpitation,
Each solitary note whose genius calleth,
Each swaggering blade had talked his fill.
Each then selects in time what suits his bent.
Each twirls about and never stops,
Earth's joys o'erleaping, leaveth them behind.
Earth's sad reality,
Earth's splendour whirls in circling flight;
Earth-spirit, thou to me art nigher,
Echo's voice prolongs the chime.
Edition: 10
Either a kaiser's or a chancellor's lot.
Else freely I would treat each worthy guest
Else to yon depths profound it you will hurl.
Embalmed the departed,
Embracing heaven and earth in rapture high,
Enamour'd hatred, quickening vexation.
Encamp around to guard me and defend!—
Enclosure between the City-wall and the Gate. (In the niche of the wall a devotional image of the Mater dolorosa, with flower-pots before it.)
End of the Project Gutenberg Etext of Faust Part 1, by Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe
Endow your soul with pinions;—
Engage the attention of her friend!
Enjoy, in proud delight what no one knows,
Enough of this! Thy true love dwells apart,
Enough! 'tis granted thee! Divert
Enraptured, I had rendered up my soul!
Ensnares the soul, consumes the blood;
Enter a new career;
Enwrapp'd in magic's veil profound,
Ere I retire, one boon I must solicit:
Ere long be sure your poor sick heart will quake!
Ere long thou wilt proceed with pleasure,
Ere long to meet again!
Erewhile, my passion would not brook delay!
Error instead of truth abroad to send
Essence of deadliest powers, refin'd and sure,
Eternal!—Yes, its end would be despair.
Eternally are swiftly whirled.
Even for me too mad these people are.
Even the very Host, my envy stirs.
Ever too prone is man activity to shirk,
Everywhere growth and movement are rife,
Example FTP session:
Except his cup of gold.
Except this knotty staff. Beside,
Excitement is the sphere for man.
Excuse me, fine harangues I cannot make,
Excuse me, friend, far now the night is spent,
Excuse me, gentlemen; to me's assign'd
Excuse my triumphing with all my soul.
Explain, ere further time we lose,
Exults if earth-worms second his endeavour.

FROSCH (pours a glass of wine over his head)
Fails to allay the tumult in his blood.
Fain they would allure thee hence:
Fain would I please the public, win their thanks;
Fain would the girls inquire indeed
Fair dream, it vanish'd with the parting day!
Fair lady, may I thus make free
Fair was I too, and that was my undoing.
Fairly outwept seem now her tears,
Faith! he's a knowing one!
False calves I now have worn for many a year.
False witness borne, until this hour?
Fann'd by the magic breath your march surrounding.
Fans the Aeolian harp, my numbers roll;
Faoscn (sings)
Faoscn, BRANDER, SIEBEL, ALTMAYER,
Far off the drums are beating.
Far off, are 'gainst each other fighting.
Far otherwise the pleasures of the mind,
Far reaching, with a hundred veins,
Far, far above;
Farewell!
Fate hath endow'd him with an ardent mind,
Father, I'm thine! Do thou deliver me!
Fathom'd by Being such as thou?
Faust Part 1 by Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe
Faust, and thine equal, I am he!
Feeding on hope's sweet dew thy blissful pains!
Feel in your labouring breast the six-days' birth,
Feelings of joy my breast inspire
Feelings, all power of speech above;
Fetch me a gimlet here!
Fie on you!
Fiend, help me to cut short the hours of dread!
Fiercely didst thrust me from the realm of thought
Fill thence thy heart, how large soe'er it be;
Find utterance without art or rule;
Finding them often beyond his ken;
First a diploma must belief infuse,
First came thy passion with o'erpowering rush,
First, to the devil the guitar I'll send!
First-love and friendship their fond accents blending,
Fit utterance for feeling, deep, intense,
Five lectures daily you must hear;
Flaring the swift destructions play;
Flash the bright hues of garments gay.
Flash the red beams—
Flies and midges all unite
Flutter their vestures bright
Fly away! little bird, fly away! fly away!
Follows their forms of light
Fond yearning love, inspire my breast,
Fondly we weep
Fools he lureth, and the fair,
For Christmas gift, with grateful joy possess'd,
For downright paradox, no doubt,
For ghosts and f or the devil 'tis a law.
For he his counterpart bath found
For him and him only
For him from the window
For if my judgment you desire,
For jerkin and for hose!
For jurisprudence, Some distaste I own.
For my sake only courteous be!
For next to nothing went she there;
For now your fancies to expel,
For now-a-days it much avails. Indeed
For once, I e'en to thee feel gratitude.
For one brief hour then may I never rest,
For solace yearns, ye still impart
For some grand lady taketh thee!
For some high pageant richly dight!
For still the fairest gifts the fatherland bestows.
For stranger crowds the Orphean lyre now stringing,
For streams of life the spirit yearneth,
For such a base, half-hellish brood,
For that fair image fans a raging fire;
For that which is or is not in the head
For there precisely where ideas fail,
For these and other matters, please mail to:
For they themselves have risen, with joy,
For things above the earth we learn to pine,
For this time gaze your fill, and when you please
For this time have I leave to go?
For this time we must say adieu.
For tickets are content their necks to break.
For to be plain, I love to see the throng,
For torturing flames
For truly I must own that we
For we chopp'd straw before her door would strew!
For when to the devil's house we speed,
For which I prayed! Not vainly hast thou turn'd
For which another many a year must plead;
For wife and children when from Malta bound;—
For witches easier are to me
For with the people, as with women, they
For within this lonely cell,
For your mean purpose basely sport away?
Forbear the lovely girl to name!
Forbear thy howling!
Forbear to trifle longer with thy grief,
Forbear!
Forbear, my child! Thou feelest thee I love;
Foreboding angel! check thy fear!
Forgotten hast reposed for many a year!
Forsooth dost pity her?
Forth from the hollow, gloomy gate,
Forth in the world abroad to roam,
Forth through the cellar-door I saw him ride—
Forthwith in this our narrow booth appear,
Forthwith must leave the cell.
Fortress with turrets
Fortune seems now propitious, adverse now,
Forward, Dame Baubo! Honour to you!
Fountains of foaming wine
Free am I! There's none shall hinder me.
Freely, some mountain height sublime,
Fresh from the spirit's depths, with strong control
Friends everywhere, and not a few,
Frog and cricket in the mosses,—
Frogs and crickets in the mosses,
From Blocksberg coming in swift gallop, bleat
From all the world conceal'd!
From ashy rest
From bed full oft must rise, whene'er its cry I heard,
From bonds of toil, from care and annoy,
From crag and dewy grove, the silvery forms
From craving to enjoyment thus I reel,
From crowded alley and narrow street,
From devils, touching angels too,
From error's sea to rise, hope still renews!
From every quarter threaten man's estate,
From every sin absolved and free;
From faith her darling, miracle, hath sprung.
From fire to fire, we'll saunter at our leisure,
From five and six,
From gable and roof's o'er-hanging gloom,
From heaven claimeth he the fairest star,
From heaven to earth their genial influence bringing,
From heaven's dread Lord, I sought to wrest.
From journal-reading hurry to the play.
From marshy bogs we sprang to light,
From one fix'd order ne'er to swerve!
From our own cellar to the very best.
From out thine antiquated case, where thou
From paradise it bath been so.
From rude knots with life embued,
From sea to land, from land to sea,
From seraph-voices, in glad triumph ringing,
From tenement sordid, from cheerless room,
From the dark grave bath fled,
From the ungenial east they issue forth,
From their strange manners; they have scarce been here
From them he streameth, them he maketh fair,
From this vile crew, with sudden bound,
From this wild wand'ring in the desert springs?—
From thy dear looks and words would o'er me steal?
From which I've sipp'd myself ere now;
Fugitive from hell?
Full in my view climbs up the pathless sky,
Full in the thunder's path careering,
Full many a goodly place I know,
Full many a greeting and kind compliment.
Full many a one stands living here,
Full many a riddle will be there untied.
Full many an anguish'd bound he gave,
Full measure I might hope to win
Full of devotion am I come
Full of the living faith,
Full oft is self-conceit and blindness!
Full oft the poet's thought for years bath waited
Full oft this sad experience hath been mine;
Full soon the public will in pieces rend it.

Gaily careering,
Gaily the soldier
Gay bachelors, a hopeful crew.
Gay sports and festive hours proclaim'd with joyous pealing,
Gayest me glorious nature for my realm,
Gaze not upon her! 'Tis not good! Forbear!
Gaze upwards on thy Son's death agony.
Gems brightly gleam.
Gently to lead him as I choose!
Girt round with noise and youthful riot;
Girt with celestial might,
Give a good glass, and straight we'll praise you, one and all.
Give ground! Squire Voland comes!
Give me a glass of genuine sweet!
Give me a little wax—and make some stoppers—quick!
Give me thy hand! It is no dream! 'Tis true!
Give me unquell'd those impulses to prove;—
Give me, oh give me back my youth again!
Give us a song!
Gives strength, though fathom him none may;
Gives strength, though fathom thee none may;
Gladly seek they the sun to-day;
Gladness I ne'er again shall know.
Go on, I pray!
Go to! I laugh, the while you rail,
Go, you'll laugh at me!
God knows, I lov'd him from my heart.
God knows, it was so sweet, so dear!
God pardon my dear husband, he
Gold all doth lure,
Gold doth secure
Gone to carouse,
Good company at least our hearts will cheer.
Good heavens! how all things far and near
Good night, you poor, poor thing!
Good sir, these things you view indeed,
Good!
Good! A remedy
Good! If I catch thee with my guile!
Good, if I have my choice, the Rhenish I propose;
Good-bye!
Gossip! For wares like these the time's gone by,
Grandly illume his palace! Thou
Grapes from the spreading vine
Grapes the vine-stock bears,
Grasp at the loftiest words to speak my flame,
Grasps thee, the demigod! Where's now the soul's deep cry?
Gretchen full soon your own you'll name.
Gretchen!
Gretchen! Gretchen!
Gretchen, he called!—
Gretchen?
Grey is, young friend, all theory:
Grim horror seizes thee!
Grow torpid in the din of earthly strife.
Gulp it down!
Gush from the pressure.
Gush'd forth, a fount for ever flowing;
Gush'd from his eyes the tear.

HUCKSTER-WITCH
Ha! Ha Just like yourself! You are, I ween,
Ha! Ha! You lick your lips already at the thought.
Ha! How my heart is riven now!
Had I but a certificate!
Had I not flame selected as my sphere
Had I plenty of pelf,
Had he but given you at home,
Hadst thou not given him a gleam of heavenly light;
Hadst thou the laughing mood not long forsworn.
Hail precious phial! Thee, with reverent awe,
Hail to the tumult!
Half God in thy young heart!
Half childish sport,
Half through the night and all day long.
Hallow'd and peaceful, my soul within,
Hand me thy cap and gown; the mask
Hand us thy liquor without more delay.
Hang heaven and earth, from which the withered heart
Hangs on your neck with fond caressing,
Haply she, also, whom I hold so dear,
Happy as cannibals are we,
Happy the man around whose brow he binds
Hard by there shineth something with peculiar glare,
Hark how the trumpet
Hark the rustling! Hark the singing!
Hark to the choral strain,
Hark! Sounds of village mirth arise;
Hark! Splinter'd are the columns that upbore
Hark! Through the woods the tempests roar!
Hark! did you rightly catch the words? a flea!
Hark! of the newest fashion is my song!
Hark! the mountain ridge along,
Hark! with shrewd intelligence,
Has been betroth'd and then betray'd;
Has neither nature nor a noble mind
Has your heart ne'er attach'd itself as yet?
Has youth displayed such arrogant pretence.
Hast done?
Hast ruddy gold, that still doth flow
Hast thou naught else to say? Is blame
Hast thou this system into ruin hurl'd,
Hath all my bones laid,
Hath but a poodle scap'd and left me here?
Hath e'en the devil in its sphere embraced;
Hath eaten me too!
Hath me already scented out;
Hath nights of boyhood to fond memory brought.
Hath not been poured hot poison's wasting flood.
Hath not some direful mischief wrought.
Hath with the full round cheek of childhood, here,
Haughty and fair,
Have I my visage masked to-day?
Have I not shown and demonstrated too,
Have chew'd this bitter fare from year to year,
Have cluster'd round this patriarchal throne!
Have died on crosses, or in flames been thrown.—
Have faith and here's a miracle!
Have patience! I will show him up anon!
Have power to entertain so wise a man.
Have you of God, the world, and all it doth contain,
He always treating her to pastry and to wine.
He cannot move external things;
He comes!
He doth to daring deeds incite:
He doubtless fabled as he parted hence.—
He feasted there on butter,
He for a future snare doth lightly spread.
He grins at me, untroubled as before;
He growls, doubts, lays him on his belly, too,
He had a gallant air, I trow,
He hath not, as you know, an hour to live.
He in eternal brightness doth exist,
He in my bosom with malicious zeal
He into mist will melt away.
He is your proper man.
He knows not the kettle!
He knows not the pot!
He lied! What, on the brink of death to lie!
He lifts himself with threat'ning mien,
He looks around him with a mocking sneer,
He loves me!
He loves me—loves me not.
He loves me—not—he loves me—not—
He must adjudge, when others dance;
He must not go disconsolate.
He only from one point can heal.
He push'd a maiden trimly dress'd,
He ran around, he ran abroad,
He saw it splashing, drinking,
He seems to take to her.
He serves thee truly in a wondrous fashion.
He spreads the couch of soft delight!
He still degrades me to myself, and turns
He too's a genuine devil.
He tracks the game where'er he can,
He wearies me, and would with thanks be paid
He wheels, each circle closer than before?
He who would know and treat of aught alive,
He whom we mourned as dead,
He will not soon escape, I promise you.
He won't be such a fool! a gallant lad
He wore a star of state;
He's most annoyed, so soon as we advance;
He's my good friend, with whom 'twill prosper well;
Healing and strengthening woes,
Hearken to love's plaintive lays;
Hearken! The end I aim at is not joy;
Heaven bless the trusty friend, and long
Heaven's lamps employ, the greatest and the least,
Heavens! only look! what have we here!
Heavy as lead my feet are growing.
Held as in prison.
Hell's flames are all aglow!
Hell's old lynx is quaking there,
Help! from disgrace and death deliver me!
Hemmed in by book-heaps, piled around,
Hence I sit fearless on my goat,
Hence also my heart must all pleasure forego!
Hence overshadowing gloom,
Hence this companion purposely I give,
Hence to the everlasting resting-place,
Hence, 'tis but fit, their hearts to cheer,
Hence, my young friend, I would advise,
Henceforth absolve me from my task,
Henceforth some other task essay,
Henry! Henry!
Henry! I shudder now to look on thee!
Her I can ne'er forget, ne'er lose her love;
Her cheek's soft light, her rosy lips,
Her direful doom fall crushing on my head,
Her downward glance in passing by,
Her glance and mien far more betray.
Her grandsire's wither'd hand devoutly press'd.
Her homely cares in that small world embraced,
Her image fades, in veiling mist obscur'd
Her myrtle wreath the boys would tear;
Her nature in a deep and soothing sleep.
Her only trespass a delusion dear!
Her proud head she will have to bow,
Her to the burning south transport,
Her vital powers, her embryo seeds survey,
Her, and her peace as well,
Here 'tis so close, so sultry now,
Here I abide with pleasure.
Here am I man, I feel it here.
Here and there, our path across.
Here by a ribbon hangs a little key!
Here could I linger hours untold;
Here is a casket, with a store
Here is a juice, makes drunk without delay;
Here is a little phial,—if she take
Here is a song, sung o'er, sometimes you'll see,
Here is my album, do not, Sir, deny
Here is the maid! the knave is there!
Here is the window, here the door,
Here lay the child, her bosom warm
Here rest we from our walk. In times long past,
Here sit I, like a king upon his throne;
Here there is no repose to-day.
Here through the mist the light doth shine;
Here through the valley see it glide;
Here to the altar camest,
Here too it is the best, to listen but to one,
Here too my efforts are in vain!
Here too thou'rt free to act without control;
Here vapours rise, there clouds float by,
Here we conveyed Him,
Here we together are. Proceed.
Here will we house ourselves in quiet.
Here!
Here's just a girl with whom one may make free!
Here, as a youth of high degree,
Here, doctor, grasp me! With a single bound
Here, even if I would, for me there's no disguise.
Here, what doth fail me, shall I find?
Here, where its force the gorge restrains,
Hereby may you be quite aware
Herself to suckle the poor babe, so I
Heyday! How smart! The fresh young blood!
Him I believe?
Him fear not, my sweet love!
Him loved he without feigning,
Him who dare name?
Him will I drag through life's wild waste,
Him, canst thou seize, thy power exert
Himself half conscious of his frenzied mood;
Himself to be a perfect whole esteems:
His aspect to the powers supernal
His bearing high,
His body from his soul I'd soon divide!
His cities o'er he told;
His death I fain would in the journals read.
His eyes meanwhile were sinking,
His failings too he deeply did repent,
His friend would be with him, the curly-head.
His hand's fond pressure,
His heart can steel,
His heart's most glad whose hand is free.
His life is ebbing fast, I see,
His lofty step,
His lore thou gladly wilt receive;
His lyre celestial stringing.—
His master's track to find once more.
His presence chills my blood.
His presents, she did not disdain;
His tailor then he summon'd,
His time in dark alchemic cell,
His witching words,
Hither bring thine homely aid,
Ho! ho!
Hoarsely each passing moment sings.
Hold, or blows shall rain on you!
Holding the man she loves, Fore-doomed to endless death!
Holds and sustains he not
Holla! my friend! may I request your light?
Hollo! Hollo! Ho!
Honour to her, to whom honour is due!
Honour win, us rightly leading,
Honour your rising stars alone!
Hope has already fled my breast.
Hope's budding joy in the vale doth blow;
Hope's gracious bloom, with promise rife;
Horns the buck-goat wears!
Hound! Execrable monster!—Back with him, oh thou infinite spirit! back with the reptile into his dog's shape, in which it was his wont to scamper before me at eventide, to roll before the feet of the harmless wanderer, and to fasten on his shoulders when he fell! Change him again into his favourite shape, that he may crouch on his belly before me in the dust, whilst I spurn him with my foot, the reprobate!—Not the first!—Woe! Woe! By no human soul is it conceivable, that more than one human creature has ever sunk into a depth of wretchedness like this, or that the first in her writhing death-agony should not have atoned in the sight of all-pardoning Heaven for the guilt of all the rest! The misery of this one pierces me to the very marrow, and harrows up my soul; thou art grinning calmly over the doom of thousands!
Hover round, above, below,
How Cupid stirs and gambols in thy heart.
How all things live and work, and ever blending,
How all unlike the influence of this sign!
How blest is he to whom kind fate decrees,
How blest the ape would think himself, if he
How blest within whose breast truth reigneth pure!
How blest, in whom the fond desire
How bright the sphere,
How brittle, alas!
How by persuasion can he govern men?
How comes it that thou dost not shrink from me?—
How comes this lovely casket here? The press
How curt and sharp her answer too,
How different, Gretchen, was it once with thee,
How earnest thou in, if this thine exit bar?
How fares it with your heart?
How for so long can it have charms for you?
How from yon sacristy, athwart the night,
How him alone all hope abandons never,
How holds it still together?
How in the mountain Mammon glows.
How is it now? How speeds it? Is't in train?
How it revolts the genuine artist's mind!
How little either sire or son,
How long at this conceit I've swept with all my might,
How long is it her wont to roam?
How long she hung upon the youth!
How make our entertainment striking, new,
How mean such handicraft as this you cannot feel!
How mean you that? have you of every sort?
How mean you, Sir?
How my poor heart, without relief,
How naively they're jesting!
How name ye that stiff formal man,
How o'er the river's ample sheet,
How oft the children of a by-gone race
How pleasantly one loses;
How powers celestial, rising and descending,
How quails mine inmost being now!
How sadly, yonder, with belated glow
How say you now? 'Tis no such paltry room
How so?
How so?
How stoutly once I could inveigh,
How strangely doth a single crimson line
How the dull boors exulting shout!
How they puff and multiply!
How they recommend to thee
How they snort, and how they blow!
How thrills my pulse with strange delight!
How through the air the storm doth whirl!
How through the chasms strangely gleams,
How thy religion fares, I fain would hear.
How would thy weary days have flown?
How wouldst thou rue thy guilty flame!
How! add insult, too!
How! goes the fellow on a halting foot?
How, dearest? canst thou kiss no more!
How?
How?
How?
How? Where? The treasure hath he buried, pray?
Huge as a hippopotamus,
Hundreds swell his joyous shout,
Hurrah for wine and freedom still!
Hush! hush! be still! I come to set thee free!
Hush'd is the fiddle, check'd the dance.
I HAVE, alas! Philosophy,
I almost think, no more I love thee then.
I am afraid the landlord to offend;
I am beside myself with joy,
I am no lady, am not fair,
I am no nearer to the infinite.
I am not like the gods! Feel it I must;
I am not used to it, nor can myself degrade
I am thy servant, am thy slave indeed!
I am, in truth, of humble blood—
I beg most humbly to salute
I bless my stars at least that mine is not
I but entreat thee now to follow me!
I but keep time,
I can provide such treasures, it is true;
I cannot loose the bands of the avenger, nor withdraw his bolts.—Save her!—Who was it plunged her into perdition? I or thou?
I cannot suffer here to dwell.
I cannot the mere Word so highly prize;
I climb'd forthwith to reach the prize.
I come in gold-lac'd scarlet vest,
I crave excitement, agonizing bliss,
I crept near the confessor's chair.
I dare not go! I've naught to hope for more.
I drown'd my child beneath the wave.
I fain would die.
I fain would know it.
I fain would meet with such a man;
I feel it, I have heap'd upon my brain
I feel it, spirit, prayer-compell'd, 'tis thou
I feel it, you but spare my ignorance,
I feel my heart surrender'd unto thee!
I feel myself so small with other men.
I feel new rapture, hallow'd and intense,
I feel oppressed!
I feel so strange, I know not how—
I feel, alas! With this exalted joy,
I felt a shock, it went through every limb!
I felt myself shrink dwarf'd as I survey'd!
I felt myself so small, so great;
I felt with holy joy a world reveal'd.
I find it never,
I find it never,
I find it never,
I float and I wave
I fondled it the live-long night;
I for his soul will many a requiem pray.
I for this cause should fear to love.
I from a witness fain had heard,
I gather some conclusion.
I gaze on thee, my pain is lull'd to rest;
I gaze, at home;
I grasp thee, calm'd the tumult in my breast;
I grudge him not the choicest of thy store.
I grudge you not, of specious lies.
I guess they're from the Rhenish land.
I had a . . . . .have ready here,
I hate the tumult of the vulgar throng;
I have a mind to open it and see!
I have done all to please thee in the past!
I have no name for it!
I have not hurt him in the least.
I have thee unconditionally then!
I heard the doctor catechised,
I here may exercise my arts awhile.
I hobble after, many a day;
I hold with stout persistence,
I honour them.
I hope that we shall soon agree!
I in his presence needs must blush for shame.
I know it well, so rings the book throughout;
I know not what they shape and brew.
I know not, dearest, when thy face I see,
I know not—shall I?
I know the art to hit the public taste,
I know you now,—and therefore will retire;
I like not acid wine, I must allow,
I loathe alike their form and features!
I locked, of that I'm confident.
I look around, I seek him as I pass,
I love to linger where thou stayest. (caressing him.)
I may not pretend, aught rightly to know,
I may not pretend, through teaching, to find
I mean, has passion never stirred your breast?
I must a bit o'erlook them now.
I must away.
I must confess, my stepping o'er
I must translate it otherwise,
I ne'er have cherished hate for such as thee.
I ne'er have seen thee in my life before!
I need not conjure long it seems,
I need not tell you how—to close!
I needs must cling, though cold and insolent,
I now am at thy mercy quite.
I now must introduce to you
I own,
I own, within me the delusion's strong,
I pause, perplex'd! Who now will help afford?
I praise the good old ways, to them I hold,
I pray you do!
I rarely go from home,—no, not a word
I reared it up, and it grew fond of me.
I rub my hands, I scratch my head,—
I sat there on my pallet,
I saw among them some such thing,
I see a theatre,—what's going on?
I see alone mankind's self-torturing pains.
I sent my mother to her grave,
I shall remember: pause, ere 'tis too late.
I shot in starry splendour;
I should prefer my dismal path to bound.
I soon will lead him where more light appears;
I still have an embarrass'd air, and then
I stood by his bedside. Something less foul it was than dung;
I swear it seemeth like a dream to me.
I swear to you, 'twill turn her brain;
I take the cup you kindly reach,
I tell thee, from vain tears abstain!
I tell you what;—your speculative churl
I tell you, give them more, still more, 'tis all I ask,
I thank you; for not willingly
I then should be wise.
I to my neighbour shall not reach thee now,
I to the upper ranks do not belong;
I to this theme will close mine ears,
I took a peep, therein are stored,
I traffic with the dead, and still aver
I tremble so!
I trust mine errand you'll not let me rue;
I trust you're not by avarice led!
I was confused. So had it never been;
I weep, I weep, I weep,
I will conduct thee. And what I can do,—hear! Have I all power in heaven and upon earth? I'll cloud the senses of the warder,—do thou possess thyself of the keys and lead her forth with human hand! I will keep watch! The magic steeds are waiting, I bear thee off. Thus much is in my power.
I will make free to call again at eve.
I wish my mother would come home.
I wish you joy of your new life-career.
I wonder is the wine still flowing!
I would entreat you longer yet to stay;
I would entreat your friendly care!
I would give something now to know,
I would not lead you willingly astray,
I would not live with such an one as he.
I write, "In the beginning was the Deed!"
I'd prize it far beyond the costliest dress,
I'd rather be above, though, I must own!
I'd yield me to the devil instantly,
I'll bring him straight.
I'll cherish thee with ardour thousand-fold;
I'll join the rest.
I'll parry I do you thrust away!
I'll pledge myself to be thy servant here,
I'll sing a masterpiece of art:
I'm but a foolish timid thing!
I'm dying—'tis a soon-told tale,
I'm glad of that! a pact may then be made,
I'm hurried along,
I'm in no mood to see him now,
I'm like a tom-cat in a thievish vein,
I'm like the earth-worm, writhing in the dust,
I'm loath the guest-right to withhold;
I'm near her still—and should I distant rove,
I'm not at home to corpses; 'tis my way,
I'm on a level but with such as thou;
I'm sorry I'm so blind!
I'm still so young, so young—
I'm weary of the dry pedantic tone,
I've everywhere been well received, I own.
I've known and hated long enough.
I've mark'd him long, naught strange in him I see!
I've my amusement in it too!
I've ventur'd to intrude to-day.
I've youthful blood and courage high;
I, God's own image!
I, God's own image, from this toil of clay
I, more than cherub, whose unfetter'd soul

INTRODUCTORY NOTE
Idle your toil; the chase you may forego!
If I am skill'd the countenance to read,
If I mistake not, two draw near.
If a poor maiden went astray;
If bards ye are, as ye maintain,
If but a friendly hint be thrown,
If by the spirit guided as I read.
If death lurk there!
If e'er upon my couch, stretched at my ease, I'm found,
If feeling prompt not, if it doth not flow
If fitly things blend,
If for a moment he but enter here,
If for six stallions I can pay,
If good luck attend,
If he a . . . does not fear.
If he be one, have at him;—well I wot
If husband scold and wife retort,
If it but stirred;
If it so please thee, I'm at thy command;
If leave to me thou wilt but give,
If men hereafter hate and love,
If nature boon, or subtle sprite,
If not a spouse, a gallant let it be.
If o'er my soul the tone familiar, stealing,
If on each step his say's not said,
If round a wondering glance we cast,
If she should get him, 'twere almost as bad!
If such your wish, why then, I say,
If thine, or whose, it matters not, I trow.
If this will satisfy thy mind,
If thou art human, feel my misery!
If thou dost feel 'tis I, then come with me!
If thou thy sire dost honour in thy youth,
If thou wert a thief or no?
If to approach more near I'm fondly lur'd,
If unprepar'd, however, this man drink,
If we are bit, &c.
If we are bit, we catch them,
If ye forthwith salute him with respect profound!
If ye would circle in one narrow round,
If yet they live, now wander widely parted.

If you have nothing better to suggest,
If, waft'd on the desert's flaming wing,
Imagined evils chill thy blood,
Impedes the tenor of life's onward way!
Impels me, and its sacred lore,
Imprison me!
Improvement in this art is now my aim,
In Naples as he stroll'd, a stranger there,—
In Spanish boots so tightly laced,
In a short time you will improve, my friend,
In a small circle one is not alone,
In air sylph shall dwindle,
In all my days ne'er saw I such a sight!
In all your life say, have you ne'er
In blissful dreams of future joy.
In bonds of love enfold you, mercy-fraught,
In chief, of incident enough prepare!
In coming here, as ever, thy sole aim?
In darksome corners thou wilt bide,
In depths of sensual pleasure drown'd,
In every ear that ceaseless rings,
In every garb I needs must feel oppress'd,
In every heap of dung he thrusts his nose.
In fact, our legal advisors said we can't even change margins.
In fair lace collar simply dight
In faltering cadence, as when Zephyr playing,
In fearful and entangled fall,
In flesh and blood ere long thou shalt survey.
In flesh and blood she brought before my view.
In glitt'ring rows advancing.
In his castle o'er the sea.
In holy ground at Padua.
In holy ground his body lies;
In hope, through spirit-voice and might,
In length and breadth how doth my poodle grow!
In likeness of a dog no longer seen!
In manhood, dost thou spread the bounds of truth,
In mazy circles dancing!
In misery! despairing! long wandering pitifully on the face of the earth and now imprisoned! This gentle hapless creature, immured in the dungeon as a malefactor and reserved for horrid tortures! That it should come to this! To this!—Perfidious, worthless spirit, and this thou hast concealed from me!—Stand! ay, stand! roll in malicious rage thy fiendish eyes! Stand and brave me with thine insupportable presence! Imprisoned! In hopeless misery! Delivered over to the power of evil spirits and the judgment of unpitying humanity I—And me, the while, thou wert lulling with tasteless dissipations, concealing from me her growing anguish, and leaving her to perish without help!
In moisture, drought, heat, cold, they still appear!
In my heart's core all human weal and woe,
In nations put his trust, who may,
In person you are tolerably made,
In physiognomy strange skill she shows;
In rhythmic flow to music's measur'd tone?
In rocky hollows and in caverns drear,
In satin and in velvet,
In seasons past we snatch'd, 'tis true,
In secret she is brought to light,
In sprang the dog, indeed, observing naught;
In such a wretched plight, and then at length
In tepid bath was with the lily wed.
In that great moment, rapture-fraught,
In the Intermezzo
In the busy world to dwell,
In the currents of life, in action's storm,
In the deep heart of man care builds her nest,
In the full living beauty still rejoice!
In the pond.
In the rich sunset see how brightly glow
In the wild tumult of the hour is drown'd;
In these pure symbols do I see,
In thine own bosom the lost world restore!
In this mood thou mayst venture it. But make
In this recumbent form, supremely fair,
In this small cell what bliss profound!
In thy dear light, ah, might I climb,
In thy mild haze o'er meadows glide,
In truth the subtle web of thought
In unconditioned rest he fain would live;
In unquiet mood
In us the better soul doth waken,
In vain abroad you range through science' ample space,
In vain, his form I nowhere can behold.
In vain,—he fast was Sinking;
In wait for mischief, they are prompt to hear;
In winning this sweet child succeed.
In words we can conveniently believe,
In yon proud ball ancestral,
In yon wide and desert region!
In youth's wild years, with vigour crown'd,
Incomparable Sibyl cease, I pray!
Incubus! Incubus!
Inferring from the devils here,
Infinite longing!

Inhuman monster, without aim or rest,
Inscrutable in broadest light,
Insensibly are link'd, they scarce know how;
Instead of nature's living sphere,
Instead of sitting throned midst forests wild,
Intermezzo
Into the flood below.
Into the path of error strike.
Is dead? True heart! Oh misery!
Is evermore a luckless wight!
Is fain to slake with hearty zest:
Is for my purpose quite first rate.
Is for the damsel far too good;
Is force creative then of Sense the dower?
Is held as valid everywhere;
Is here approved on principle, I find.
Is in exact accordance with my vow.
Is in the outer angle found.
Is it not dust, wherewith this lofty wall,
Is it on that account less mine?
Is it permitted here with you to sit?
Is just the thing that pleases me the best.
Is like a beast which some ill spirit leads,
Is like the weaver's fabric wrought:
Is merely their own spirit after all,
Is morrow's dawn not time enough?
Is not this book of mystery
Is overwrought;
Is piquant too, and sharp withal.
Is saved!
Is strain'd to catch some new sensation!
Is that of sophistry a devilish play?
Is the grave; and all
Is thy prayer utter'd for thy mother's soul,
Is turned to gall.
Is yonder flasket there a magnet to my sight?
Is't done, the deed?
Is't not enough, that by the word I gave,
Is't not mere masquerading?
Is't possible? Hath woman charms so rare?
Is, as thou seest, not quite closed.
It all depends on habit. Thus at first
It doubtless may be very flue;
It fain would rise,
It finds us genuine children e'en in eld.
It forms a curious chapter, I admit.
It is a general custom, too.
It is as if the folk had nothing else to do,
It is as if the organ
It is enough to drive me to despair!
It is for me he cometh!
It is of clay;
It need hardly be said that Goethe's "Faust" does not derive its greatness from its conformity to the traditional standards of what a tragedy should be. He himself was accustomed to refer to it cynically as a monstrosity, and yet he put himself into it as intensely as Dante put himself into "The Divine Comedy." A partial explanation of this apparent contradiction in the author's attitude is to be found in what has been said of its manner of composition. Goethe began it in his romantic youth, and availed himself recklessly of the supernatural elements in the legend, with the disregard of reason and plausibility characteristic of the romantic mood. When he returned to it in the beginning of the new century his artistic standards had changed, and the supernaturalism could now be tolerated only by being made symbolic. Thus he makes the career of Faust as a whole emblematic of the triumph of the persistent striving for the ideal over the temptation to find complete satisfaction in the sense, and prepares the reader for this interpretation by prefixing the "Prologue in Heaven." The elaboration of this symbolic element is responsible for such scenes as the Walpurgis Night and the Intermezzo, scenes full of power and infinitely suggestive, but destructive of the unity of the play as a tragedy of human life. Yet there remains in this First Part even in its final form much that is realistic in the best sense, the carousal in Auerbach's cellar, the portrait of Martha, the Easter-morning walk, the character and fate of Margaret. It is such elements as these that have appealed to the larger reading public and that have naturally been emphasized by performance on the stage, and by virtue of these alone "Faust" may rank as a great drama; but it is the result of Goethe's broodings on the mystery of human life, shadowed forth in the symbolic parts and elaborated with still greater complexity and still more far-reaching suggestiveness—and, it must be added, with deepening obscurity—in the Second Part, that have given the work its place with "Job," with the "Prometheus Bound," with "The Divine Comedy," and with "Hamlet."
It now at least must be confessed,
It pictures straight the final close.
It ringeth like glass!
It riseth and falleth ever;
It seemed as if it struck him suddenly,
It seems your dame is not at home?
It seems, she's partly in the right.
It should have been my bridal! No one tell,
It shows no broader than a knife's blunt edge!
It so o'ermasters me, that when,
It struggles still!
It would become so great a lord
It would to shrift, just like the other.
It's own reward our gallant action brought;
Its Eden-brightness alternating
Its beams the ever-burning taper throws,
Its bloom is o'er!
Its dark brown flood thy crystal round doth fill;
Its magic and alluring spell,
Its notes it doth redouble.
Its sack an airy bubble.
Its victim to this dreary cell!
Its warm bays heaving with a tranquil motion,
Its winding path is sweetly running;
JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE, the greatest of German men of letters, was born at Frank fort-on-the-Main, August 28, 1749. His father was a man of means and position, and he personally supervised the early education of his son. The young Goethe studied at the universities of Leipsic and Strasburg, and in 1772 entered upon the practise of law at Wetzlar. At the invitation of Karl August, Duke of Saxe-Weimar, he went in 1775 to live in Weimar, where he held a succession of political offices, becoming the Duke's chief adviser. From 1786 to 1788 he traveled in Italy, and from 179' to 1817 directed the ducal theater at Weimar. He took part in the wars against France, 1792-3, and in the following year began his friendship with Schiller, which lasted till the latter's death in 1805. In 1806 he married Christiane Vulpius. From about 1794 he devoted himself chiefly to literature, and after a life of extraordinary productiveness died at Weimar, March 22, 1832. The most important of Goethe's works produced before he went to Weimar were his tragedy "Gotz von Berlichingen" (1773), which first brought him fame, and "The Sorrows of Young Werther," a novel which obtained enormous popularity during the so-called "Sturm und Drang" period. During the years at Weimar before he knew Schiller he began "Wilhelm Meister," wrote the dramas, "Iphigenie," "Egmont," and "Torquato Tasso," and his "Reinecke Fuchs." To the period of his friendship with Schiller belong the continuation of "Wilhelm Meister," the beautiful idyl of "Hermann and Dorothea," and the "Roman Elegies." In the last period, between Schiller's death in 1805 and his own, appeared "Faust," "Elective Affinities," his autobiographical "Dichtung und Wahrheit" ("Poetry and Truth"), his "Italian Journey," much scientific work, and a series of treatises on German Art.
Jewels! which any noble dame might wear,
Journey from heaven, thence through the world, to hell!
Joy still must sorrow, sorrow joy attend.
Joyfully ringing!
Joyous and free from care they live.
Juchheisa! Heisa! He!
Juchheisa! Heisa! He!
Juchheisa! Heisa! He!
Juchhesia! Heisa! He!
Judex ergo cum sedebit,
Judgment of God! To thee my soul I give!
Just as by other men they're view'd;
Just as we carry on a love affair.
Just lay it in the press; make haste!
Just such a drama let us now compose.
Just such a prize for you I can provide;
Just wait awhile! (She gathers a star-flower and plucks off the leaves one after another.)
Kathrina say,
Keep close, wide is the Blocksberg here
Keep time and do your duty!
Keep to the path
Kind and all-bounteous nature's loftiest dower—
Kind element, be still, I say!
Kind gentleman and ladies fair,
Kindle anew the smouldering flame!
Kindness to any one to show.
Kiss him and kiss him
Kiss me!
Know'st thou my servant, Faust?
Know'st thou the meaning of, He loveth thee?
Knows from their changeful mood no angry feeling;
Knows neither what she would or should;

Ladies, farewell!
Language: English
Laws are unheeded by the devil's host;
Laying the sunny leas,
Lead me to scenes, new life and fuller yielding!
Learn chiefly with the sex to deal!
Learn how to feel with nice address
Leather and wax usurp the mastery then.
Leave him not in mortal thrall!
Leave that to neighbour Paunch!—withdraw,
Leaving the hills behind
Lest forth you fare,
Lest thy too hasty pen be led astray!
Let but this ancient proverb be your rule,
Let deeds at length appear, my friends!
Let folly also swell the tragic chorus.
Let happen then,—what can and will.
Let him a . . . have ready here,
Let him thought's wide dominion sweep,
Let him to you the mystery show
Let him who holds the devil, hold him still!
Let me alone! O'er a full glass you'll see,
Let me but gaze one moment in the glass!
Let me my babe but suckle once again!
Let me not vainly sing my lay!
Let that day be for me the last!
Let the condition plainly be exprest!
Let them for him three hundred masses sing!
Let this hand-pressure, let this glance reveal
Let this in confidence be said:
Let this last draught, the product of my skill,
Let us begone! nor linger here!
Let us escape this ceaseless jar;
Let us our fiery passions still!
Let what must happen, happen speedily!
Let wondrous charms our senses thrill!
Let's hence, nor here our stay prolong.
Let's up to Burghof, there you'll find good cheer,
Life's in the field!
Lifts not the Heaven its dome above?
Lifts us from earth; aloft through air,
Light laden, we shall swiftly steer;—
Light will, ere long, the doom of matter share.
Like a disease, an heir-loom dread,
Like a fox in iron snare,
Like a tale of olden time,
Like an elephant he swells;
Like any Frenchman now you speak,
Like any gay Lothario,
Like any long-legged grasshopper to be,
Like brethren true and leal
Like cats with captive mice to toy and play.
Like elephants you're treading!
Like him, can roam o'er land and sea,
Like house-encumber'd Snail we creep;
Like many a youthful cavalier,
Like ministers of grace they oft appear,
Like mountain torrent, swollen by the melted snow;
Like restless quicksilver away,
Like skulking debtor I must sit,
Like sportive kitten with its tail;
Like to some ancient, half-expiring lay;
Live like a very brute the brutes among,
Living and glorious,
Lo! I am here I—What cowering agitation
Lo, where a car of fire, on airy pinion,
Lofty ambition's joy divine,
Lofty and mighty one,
Long hast been sucking at my sphere,
Long life to him who boldly dares!
Look at the wounds, how deep and how wide!
Look at those handsome fellows there!
Look now at yonder eager crew,
Look through the sieve!
Look yonder, what a dainty pair!
Look! look! yon stairs below,
Look, only look, on nimble feet,
Loose me! I will not suffer violence!
Loosed from their fetters are streams and rills
Lord Baron call thou me, so is the matter good;
Lose not this opportunity
Lost is the labour: 'tis unheard of quite!
Love-greetings and love-kisses! Thou shalt not hinder me!
Loved foreign women too, and foreign wine.
Lovers the livelong hour
Lurks in the beast:
Lurks in thy sinful heart?

Mac users, do NOT point and click, typing works better.
Madam, in truth, it grieves me sore,
Madam, with one like you it rests alone,
Magister and doctor, priest, parson, and scribe;
Magister, doctor styled, indeed,
Maiden take heed!
Maiden! I feel thy spirit haunt the place,
Maiden, beware,
Make answer, if my voice ye hear!
Make me rich in a trice,
Make seven and eight.
Make square the three,
Makes sure Olympus, heavenly powers combining?
Making thee feel thyself a man with men.
Man still must err, while he doth strive.
Man views the world, as through an optic glass,
Man's concentrated woe o'erwhelms me here!
Man's loftiest right, kind nature's high bequest,
Man's mighty spirit, in the bard reveal'd!
Man, and man's plighted word, are these unknown to thee?
Mantled with wood.
Many a gay wherry glides along;
Many a time and oft bath he
Marches away.
Mark her well! That's Lilith.
Mark me, I'll screw it from them yet!
Mark this, my friend,
Master, forgive this rude salute!
Master, thy joy!
Matters will take their course at last;
May Heaven forgive me, if I do him wrong!
May I some future time repeat my visit,
May give instruction to a preacher.
May rest, brave sons of Mieding.
May swell the number of your days.
May that which works and lives, the ever-growing,
May this wild scene my senses spare!
May your career amuse and profit too!
Mayn't I attend you, then?
Me at some distance lay—
Me canst thou cheat with glozing wile
Me doth thy strong entreaty bow—
Me every scurvy knave may twit,
Me hath she jilted once, you the same trick she'll play.
Me the great spirit scorn'd, defied;
Me with joy's lure canst thou beguile
Me with some happy word to pleasure.
Me, little angel, didst thou recognise,
Meanders now, a slender line;
Meanwhile, the treasure I see glimmering there,
Medicine, Jurisprudence too,
Melt in thin air!
Melted my inmost heart!
Men's various fortunes on my breast to heap,
Men, in their evil days, move my compassion;
Mephisto, seest thou there
Mere mummery, a laugh to raise!
Merely his lady-love to please,
Methinks 'twere well we pack'd him quietly away.
Methinks I hear in chorus roar.
Methinks I would force myself on thee, love,
Methinks a magic coil our feet around,
Methinks should also count for something too;
Method will teach you time to win;
Mice, in myriads, thousand-hued,
Mid light effulgent and celestial day:—
Mid sore annoy;
Midnight shall see our compact end.
Mingle and shift in changeful dance!
Mingles in harsh inextricable strife;
Mixed in her drink three drops, 'twill steep
Mocking themselves, Naturer encheiresis.
Model of beauty both in form and face!
More closely view your patrons of the night!
More costly than the first, by far.
More dear this feast of gold to me,
More surely to beguile her heart.
Morn is breaking.
Mortal! the loftiest attributes of men,
Mortal, all hail to thee,
Most admirable weapons words are found,
Most earnestly I now entreat,
Most like.
Most sensual, supersensualist? The while
Most tuneful serenading!
Most willingly! And here I have a flask,
Mounted on these we whirl along;
Moves his predestin'd course along;
Much time I've lost in puzzling o'er its pages,
Murk, of those flames the motley glare!
Must I be forced myself to name?
Must I seek counsel from an ancient dame?
Must I, God-hated one, to ruin hurl!
Must choose the fittest instrument.
Must fifty years be ended;
Must fill his mind,—a man like this!
Must we?
Mute are the voices that responsive rang.
My Gretchen, see! still young art thou,
My anguish'd breast is aching!
My art was powerless to detain thee here.
My bosom aches
My brain it doth well-nigh confound.
My brain, alas, is cold with dread!—
My brother! God! what can this mean?
My cousin follow still, the wily snake,
My darling, who dares say,
My doom for evermore is cast?
My every sense rules Phantasy
My fairest fortune now escapes!
My father left behind a small estate,
My father, the scoundrel,
My feeble senses
My friend he is, and need not be afraid;
My friend,
My friend, learn this to understand, I pray!
My friend, oh work this miracle to-day!
My friend, you now speak sensibly. In truth,
My future lover, last St. Andrew's E'en,
My heart and soul are in the chase!
My heart is Sore,
My heart is sore,
My heart is sore,
My heart to earth's low cares a prey.
My heart with anguish torn.
My heart, my blood I'd give, my love to prove,
My husband dead! Oh, I shall die!
My knees beneath me well-nigh sink!
My little ones these spirits be.
My little sister's dead; the babe to rear
My love is now afar, he then was nigh;
My mask it seems a hidden sense reveals;
My mother is in all things, great and small,
My mother too exacting is.
My mother, the harlot,
My naked charms displaying.
My own free choice, be quaff'd with resolute will,
My pathos soon thy laughter would awake,
My peace is gone,
My peace is gone,
My peace is gone,
My pupils by the nose,—and learn,
My sceptre this;—the crown I want alone.
My sire, of good repute, and sombre mood,
My softest cushion to thee I'll throw.
My spirit, in thy healing dew!
My steeds are shivering,
My steps I think of bending.
My strength I do not rashly overrate.
My sweet child!
My sweet little sister
My turn to laugh will come some day.
My views, in spite of doubt and sneer,
My voice to hear, to gaze upon my brow;
My weary drudgery by day and night!
My weeds I'd wear for one chaste year,
My wilder'd brain
Myself the deadly poison did to thousands give;
Myself with you would gladly rings exchange!
NIGHT
NIGHT. OPEN COUNTRY
NIGHT. STREET BEFORE MARGARET'S DOOR
NORTHERN ARTIST
Name is but sound and smoke
Nathless the cloven foot doth here give dignity.
Nathless the want admits of compensation;
Nathless, it is not meant, I trow,
Nature a method giveth to renew thy youth:
Nature and science I desire to know.
Nature exert her vital energy.
Nature from me herself doth hide;
Nature's impenetrable agencies,
Naught but a poodle black of hue I see;
Naught had I, yet a rich profusion!
Naught of this genial influence do I know!
Naught to my heart e'er gave a pang so great.
Naught was to him so dear,
Nay look at them! now only see!
Nay! Do not tremble, love!
Nay! nay!
Nay! trouble not yourself! A hand so coarse,
Nay, seize me not with hand so rude!
Nay, such discourse, be it confessed,
Ne'er from his worship's face a hint I get,
Ne'er heard before!
Ne'er master be!
Ne'er were we 'mong your dullards found,
Near yonder poplars he is sure to be.
Need speak of what I nothing know;
Neighbour! your smelling bottle!
Neither can devil nor hell now appal me—
Neither esteem it robbery
Neither o'er them can I extend my sway.
Night's closing.
Nil inultunt remanebit.
No beastliness, no folly.
No chalice, whence, into some healthy frame
No claws, no tail to whisk about,
No dagger here, which bath not flow'd with blood,
No dog in such fashion would longer live!
No drinking? Naught a laugh to raise?
No end!—It cannot end!
No form like hers can I recall.
No friendly tree is to be seen:
No garter have I to distinguish me,
No greetings to a sweetheart!
No heavy baggage need you take,
No hesitation! It will prove
No length of time will e'er eclipse!
No love-songs shall there be!
No medium is rejected;
No milk-and-water devil be,
No more respect to my red vest dost pay?
No mortal, from the cradle to the bier,
No one can then surpass us!
No one of me could any evil say.
No power, new-born, springs up within my breast;
No preparation do we need,
No rest at home can I obtain—
No rest vouchsafed me even there.
No sacrifice will he repent when made!
No spiritual control myself will bear,
No such incentives do I need.
No tittle shall remain unpaid.
No trinket! no love-token did he send!
No trinket, but bath wrought some woman's shame,
No weapon but bath cut some sacred tie,
No wing material lifts our mortal clay.
No worldly honour, rank, or pleasure;
No!
No! It is but a game.
No! No!
No, Lord! I find things there, as ever, in sad plight.
No, no! I to the town my steps retrace.
No, this new Burgomaster, I like him not, God knows,
No, thou must linger here in sorrow!
No, to some peaceful heavenly nook restore me,
Nobody else will near me lie!
None of the Four
None of your gloomy looks, I pray!
Nor are you therefore less in reverence held;
Nor could I eat in peace even my proper share."
Nor dare God's holy name profane!
Nor else would lie so bold have been.
Nor enter there,
Nor for appearance careth.
Nor gems nor trinkets are my own.
Nor give my tongue the rein until
Nor goal, nor measure is prescrib'd to you,
Nor in assurance will you be deficient:
Nor in my half-distracted sense,
Nor knows aright
Nor longer waste your hours of leisure.
Nor near the altar take in church thy place!
Nor of a single jot can we a word bereave.
Nor on thy rich device shall I my cunning show.
Nor plague me with your tiresome laws!
Nor scenes nor mechanism spare!
Nor should I want the devil's wile,
Nor third nor fourth would ever be.
Nor thoughts, nor feelings, from the mob conceal'd,
Nor venture there!
Nor will it, ignis-fatuus like,
Nor woods, nor fields, can long our thoughts engage,
Nor would I change it for the robe of kings.
Nor yield your prize,
Nose of fly and gnat's proboscis,
Nose of fly and gnat's proboscis;—
Not I! restraints of all kinds I detest.
Not definitions given, in words of weight and power,
Not every maiden is so neat.
Not far from us the one doth dwell,
Not he!
Not in the presence of a crowned king!
Not me! (Vanishes.)
Not merely with a cold and wondering glance,
Not quickly should I find another like my first!
Not quite so fast! for in our rear,
Not quite so proud! 'Tis well and good!
Not science only and consummate art,
Not so! He thought of you with tender care.
Not so, precisely do we view it;——
Not that for thrift there is such pressing need;
Not words enough my tongue could find,
Not yet is it to ruin hurl'd,
Note him! What takest thou the brute to be?
Note how the devil loves a jest to break!
Nothing I find so mawkish here below.
Nothing apart had been reserved for me.
Nothing the hapless brute could save,
Nothing to think of too,
Now all too far they wander from the right;
Now draw thy circle, speak thy spell,
Now field and meadow I've forsaken;
Now forth at once! thou dar'st not rest.
Now grasp my doublet—we at last
Now has thy brookiet ceased to flow.
Now in a pure love-dream I melt away.
Now in some puddle will he take his station,
Now in thy master's need thy grace impart!
Now into ample seas,
Now is the time, through deeds, to show that mortals
Now leave it to my wit! I ask
Now let me go! ere long I'll come again,
Now let your inspiration show it.
Now listen to the sad affair!
Now living am I!
Now measure me the youngster
Now my own trespass doth appear!
Now of the wise man's words I learn the sense;
Now only say! what liquor will you take?
Now prostrate on the grass I lie;—
Now quick! Away!
Now slumber, and all wild desires;
Now tell me, gentlemen, what you desire?
Now this one, and now that, you deeply stir,
Now to be off in time, were best!
Now to the Brocken the witches hie,
Now we are once again at our wit's end, just where the reason of you mortals snaps! Why dost thou seek our fellowship, if thou canst not go through with it? Wilt fly, and art not proof against dizziness? Did we force ourselves on thee, or thou on us?
Now we sweep
Now were I in your place, my counsel hear;
Now when all men keep holiday,
Now with unclouded sense
Now, Faustus, till we meet again, dream on.
Now, he's in office, daily more arrogant he grows;
Now, in the devil's name, for once go straight!
Now, like a fount, it bursts on high,
O Love, to waft me to her sphere,
O dearest, trust me, what doth pass for sense
O full-orb'd moon, did but thy rays
O still sound on, thou sweet celestial strain!
O that before the lofty spirit's might,
O'er Ilsenstein!
O'er death victorious;
O'er earth's wide realm my gaze extend,
O'er field and grove!
O'er head and ears is drawn;
O'er me could give?
O'er my sad heart with rapture stealing,
O'er nature's powers and every mystic zone,
O'er pine-crown'd height the eagle soars,
O'er reed and leaf the zephyr breathes—
O'er secret woes she broodeth there,
O'er spirits will he
O'er stick and o'er stone they go whirling along,
O'er such as she I've no control!
O'er the calm beauty of this hour serene!
O'er them deep night her veil doth draw;
O'er us thine azure dome,
O'erpower me with a sense of gloom;
O'ersweep the world; how near I feel to thee!

Observe it well, it is not drawn with care,
Occasion'd me some care and fond annoy;
Ocean's broad waves in wild commotion,
Of Barbara hast nothing heard?
Of Chaos thou the wondrous son!
Of a new covenant assurance gave?
Of all my arts in fullest measure!
Of all that pass'd I'm well apprized,
Of all the spirits who deny,
Of by-gone ages hover, and assuage
Of customers you'll have a rout.
Of every puddle drinking.
Of filth and fire abortion vile!
Of flies and frogs, of bugs and lice,
Of gold I bring a fair supply;
Of her good looks she was so vain,
Of instruments I hear the cursed din—
Of its brown juice to drain the crystal bowl.
Of jewels, which I got elsewhere.
Of life's fair hours, left me behind them grieving.
Of lion-dollars a rich hoard.
Of madness, I shall be restored?
Of man, and that which worketh in his heart and brain,
Of medicine the spirit's caught with ease,
Of my own bosom the mysterious depths.
Of old who listened to my song, glad hearted,
Of one make ten,
Of other cavaliers the mien I wear.
Of pardon then for every sin.
Of shows delusive curs'd be the dominion,
Of soothing anodynes abstraction pure,
Of spirits this profusion;
Of such renown deserves the meed!
Of suns and worlds I nothing have to say,
Of the elements in the finished Faust that are derived from the legend a rough idea may be obtained from the "Doctor Faustus" of Marlowe, printed in the present volume. As early as 1674 a life of Faust had contained the incident of the philosopher's falling in love with a servant-girl; but the developed story of Gretchen is Goethe's own. The other elements added to the plot can be noted by a comparison with Marlowe.
Of the right path is conscious still.
Of the whole year's unvarying round;
Of this abhorr'd and musty room!
Of this lone life have you not had your fill?
Of wares I have a choice collection:
Of what use is the sieve?
Of wisdom's dower,
Of wonders yet to be reveal'd,
Of your known juice a goblet we require.
Oft at my father's revels thou didst shine,
Oft have I watched to hail thy light:
Oh 'tis not the mere ornaments alone;
Oh God! How long is art,
Oh Henry! would that I could go with thee!
Oh could I free me from the thoughts
Oh death! I know it—'tis my famulus—
Oh do not haste!
Oh for a pinion from the earth to soar,
Oh give me the prize!
Oh let me not in vain implore!
Oh no, though strong the love, I cannot boast much skill.
Oh no—my mother would—adieu, adieu!
Oh of the motley throng speak not before me,
Oh yes! one grave and solemn prayer;
Oh! He must everywhere appear.
Oh, are there spirits in the air,
Oh, be so good,
Oh, could'st thou in my inner being read,
Oh, credit me, who still as ages roll,
Oh, dearest, let the past forgotten be!
Oh, holy man! methinks I have you there!
Oh, if it gush not from thine inmost soul,
Oh, let us kneel and move the saints by prayer!
Oh, that naught perfect is assign'd to man,
Old Winter back to the savage hills
Old bald-pate! with the paunch profound!
Old gentleman, apart, why sit ye moping here?
Old scroll, the smoke of years dost wear,
Old useless furnitures, yet stand ye here,
On Blocksberg are erected.
On May-night to the Brocken, and when there
On a chance holiday, and scarcely then,
On barren wilderness, in ceaseless whirl,
On choicest sweets your palate dwell,
On earth, a thing accursed, thou'lt live!
On him who brought them, dwells still more.
On his bosom will lie!
On his side, just as wide a range.
On holidays and Sundays naught know I more inviting
On medicine, I'll thank you to supply
On our bare soles we're running.
On pleasant summer holidays,
On rolls the stream;
On towards the isles of light
On words a system we securely ground,
On yon threshold he stood;
On! On!
On! While thou dalliest, draws her death-hour near.
Once a fair vision came to me;
Once a weird vision came to me;
Once in a cellar lived a rat,
Once more within our narrow cell,
One comes to while an hour away;
One crashing ruin whelms them all,
One from the festive board, a sated guest;
One glance, one word from thee doth charm me more,
One in the passage now doth wait!
One lieth here already dead!
One little step, and thou art free!
One must get used to it.
One of the angles, that which points without,
One or the other, mark me well,
One rustles hitherward, and soon my voice will hear.
One thunder-word hath hurl'd me from the goal!
One to the world, with obstinate desire,
One treadle moves a thousand lines,
One while I was obliged to give it food,
One's own fire-side and a good wife are gold
One's spirits are not always of the best;
One's sure to stumble 'gainst a rock or tree!
One, the play over, craves a game of cards;
Oneself amid this witchery
Oneself into the spirit of the past,
Only be quick, it matters not to me.
Only fall to and don't be over coy!
Only he loved too well abroad to roam;
Only in slightly different phrase.
Only let not your samples be too small;
Only on this condition, understand;
Only one little moment think of me!
Only reflect! The hill is magic-mad to-night;
Only resolve with courage stern and high,
Only that way not well-disposed, I fear.
Only think!
Onward I press, his quenchless light to drink,
Onward I'm summon'd o'er a boundless main,
Open stands the door.
Oppos'd to naught, this clumsy world,
Or I'll kiss thee! (She embraces him.)
Or as five hundred swine.
Or chase the fleas away.
Or dash my brains out in despair!—
Or death may befall us.
Or flush of earnest thought in evening's glow?
Or from behind bath stabb'd an enemy.
Or in the church, or any where.
Or insult back to render;
Or on the bench or in the dusky walk,
Or out at once your flickering life I'll blow.
Or still forward do we press?
Or to my arms the darling take;
Or when to steep the soul in pleasure,
Or wheresoe'er, his step I hear,
Or whom, excited by the dance, he finds
Others on pinions wide
Others will follow him anon;
Others will then esteem you a proficient.
Others, more dreaded than the rest,
Ough! ough! ough! ough!
Ought I that impulse to obey?
Our Master, so dear;
Our aspirations, our soul's genuine life,
Our course is but a zigzag one.
Our fairest cup I offer you,
Our festive meeting thus attend;
Our heart's true bliss, with god-like hand caressing.
Our homage to the devil.
Our jargon with thought
Our landlord's tool-basket behind doth yonder stand.
Our lesser worlds within the great world to create!
Our life how short! With earnest zeal
Our lingering we shall both deplore.
Our orchestra throughout the night,
Our shoes, alas, are now danced through,
Our spirits yearn for revelation,
Our swain amidst the circle press'd,
Our throats are tuned. Come let's commence!
Out of her mouth a small red mouse there sprang.
Out of the house,
Out with it then! Your doings I'll defend.
Out with your whisk, keep close, I pray,
Over the bridge

Pander, avaunt!
Panting, they rested arm in arm, Juchhe! Juchhe!
Parchment, is that the sacred fount whence roll
Pardon the freedom, Madam, with your leave,
Pardon! I heard you here declaim;
Part of that power which still Produceth good, whilst ever scheming ill.
Part of the part am I, which at the first was all,
Pass two, and then
Past which in terror others fain would steal
Patience must also bear her part.
Paunchy salamanders too
Peace, poodle, peace! Scamper not thus; obey me!
Peer, long-limbed, the bushes through!
Perchance he's dead!—oh wretched state!—
Perchance you would retain the treasure?
Perhaps 'twas brought by some one in distress.
Pervading with its quivering beams,
Physics and metaphysics weird and grey!—
Plan all things to achieve my end!
Pleading for his and thy sore misery.

Plover, owl, and jay appear,
Plunge boldly into life—its depths disclose!
Plunge we in time's tempestuous flow,
Poison for the poor rats to strew
Politeness easy is to you;
Polyp-fangs abroad they spread,
Poodle, snarl not! with the tone that arises.
Poodle, thy barking now forbear,
Poor Gretchen wilt befool, and vow
Poor Son of Earth, without my aid,
Poor fool! His food and drink are not of earth.
Poor fool, no wiser than before.
Poor fools the muses' fair regards.
Poor lad! He must be tired, I trow;
Poor simple child, I cannot see,
Poor thing!
Poor women! we are badly off, I own;
Practise the art transmitted from the past?
Practised alike by king and jew.
Praising the Lord with zeal,
Pray don't be so fastidious! She
Pray have you yet applied elsewhere?
Pray honour them with your inspection.
Pray on Walpurgis mention thy request.

Prime minister they made him,
Proceed, and tell the story of his end!

Rains blissful love.
Rang fiddle-bow and laughter.
Rapture so deep, its ecstasy was pain,
Rapture the feather'd throng,
Re-echo from this vaulted ceiling!
Read in a thousand tomes that, everywhere,
Read the uncreate,
Real is it, or a phantom show?
Reared it on milk and water all alone;
Reason and Knowledge, only thus contemn,
Reason her voice resumes; returneth
Reason, he names it, and doth so
Receive me thou, who hast in thine embrace,
Reck well my rede!
Redeem'd from decay.
Refreshment from the west at first they bring,
Rejoiced I am that I may stay.

Relieve and pity the distress'd.
Remain not hidden!
Renounce! renounce! is still the word;
Rent is the web of thought; my mind
Require a process;—one! two! three!
Resolve should by the forelock grasp;
Resounding in the thicket!
Rich odours shall regale your smell,
Rich store of treasure for the Sultan's court;
Rid of the evil one, the evil ones remain.
Right brisk, and sparkling let it be!
Right onward to the yawning gulf to press,
Right! But o'er-anxious thought, you'll find of no avail,
Right! out with him who takes offence!
Right.
Ring out your chimes believing crowds among,
Rises the ruddy moon's imperfect round,
Rocks and trees make strange grimaces,
Rocks long-snouted, row on row,
Room! wheel round! They're coming lo!
Round mountain caves with spirits ride,
Rubbish, in thousand shapes, may I not call
Running and frisking about on the hill,
Rushingly together flow.

Sage indeed!
Salamander shall kindle,
Salamander!
Salve gives the witches strength to rise;
Sancta simplicitas! For that no need!
Sans-souci, so this host we greet,
Save her!—or woe to thee! The direst of curses on thee for thousands of years!
Save it. Oh save!
Save thy poor child!
Say what has happened, what's it all about?
Say, for our scheme on German ground,
Say, what therewith to bore?
Scarce hold the throng.
Scatters he as he wings his flight,
Schnick, schnick, schnack, with nasal hum,
Science in thee I hail and human art.
Scoundrel! to rob his children of their bread!
Scratches the besom and sticks the prong;
Scruple or doubt comes not to enthrall me,
Secluded lived, a simple, artless child.
Secrets now veiled to bring to light,
Secure against his arts, forsooth!

See here, this is the scutcheon that I bear!
See then this sign,
See'st thou, through corn and stubble scampering round?
Seeks first the living spirit thence to drive:
Seem, in the answer you receive,
Seest thou yonder snail? Crawling this way she hies:
Seize it at once!
Self-confidence acquire, be not afraid,
Self-torture is the lot of human-kind,
Sense, reason, feeling, passion, but attend!
Served us, when at liberty.
Service, Organ, and Anthem
Settled!
Shades fondly loved appear, your train attending,
Shall I this time attempt to clasp, to hold ye?
Shall I with chisel, pen, or graver write?
Shall I yield, thing of flame, to thee?
Shall captivate each ravish'd sense,
Shall, if you wish it, flow without delay.
Shamefully abused,
Sharing the daily meal,
She dwells immur'd within these dripping walls;
She from confession coineth here,
She from the window sees the clouds float by
She has graz'd my side,
She in my presence feels she knows not how;
She is not the first.
She loves thee with an all-devouring flame.
She may as house and court, as wife and child appear,
She must this very night be mine,—
She now is judged!
She played the fool at last,
She rides upon a farrow sow.
She slept so long, she waked no more;
She slept, that we might taste of bliss:
She to a neighbour's house will go;
She took me and slew!
She who but now passed.
She winks not, she nods not, her head it droops sore;
She'd make the very devil marry her.
She'll cheer our souls with bread divine!"
She's past fourteen.
She's rightly served, in sooth,
Shedding so faint a light, at every tread
Sheer curiosity their footsteps winging;
Shimmer in the meteor's gleam,
Shone bright the rising morn,
Should I advise it else, sweet love?
Should be a harvest-day to me.
Should open to receive them,
Should she not work within these limbs of ours?
Should she return and enter now,
Should surely cause you no annoy.
Shouts of assent went circling round;
Show me the fruit that, ere 'tis pluck'd, doth rot,
Shows to the sex all courtesy.
Shrouding the glow of heaven.
Shudder the pure to reach
Shut to the bolt! when morning breaks,
Sight, hearing fail me, and the power of thought.
Silence! Attend! to me give ear!
Silence, old wine-cask!
Simplicity and holy innocence,—
Since Perseus cut it off.—But you I swear
Since for the last time I the Brocken scale,
Since here avails nor argument nor prayer,
Since my own spirit can exert no sway.
Since thee I now have learned to know,
Since thou hast kindly welcom'd me of yore,
Since thou the path of shame dost tread,
Since thou, O Lord, approachest us once more,
Sip as they float along;
Sir Doctor, in a walk with you
Sir Moralizer, prithee, pause;
Sit patiently, and fain would be amaz'd.
Skimming the glassy tide,
Slave am I here, at any rate,
Sleepless she rocks herself and scareth joy and rest;
Slow from the spot her drooping form she tears,
Slow sinks the orb, the day is now no more;
Smells every article to ascertain
Snake! Serpent vile!
So I suppose we straight must journey there!
So accurate!
So all is straight!
So blest I feel, within thine arms,
So curse I all, around the soul that windeth
So doth all this my brain confound,
So fades the fairy vision!
So far, as in my hand to take the spade.
So fiddle-bow was braying.
So giant-like the vision seem'd, so vast,
So hard it is to shun the erring way,
So here at home in quiet all remains!
So is that step as good as never made.
So long 'tis not forbidden thee.
So long as he on earth doth live,
So long as o'er this desk the sorry lamp hath shone.
So men, forsooth, he thinks to imitate!
So neither shall occasion fail.
So night-like gloom doth in my bosom reign.
So often show'd yourself our friend!
So on our heads we're going.
So rich thou'lt be.
So rosy-cheek'd and trimly dress'd,
So rude as mine, how can you kiss!
So shameless too, that to retain
So short a time away from me, and yet,
So soon he'll catch him not a second time.
So sweet a darling to embrace.
So tendance now I will not refuse thee;
So the whole world is also on the lees.
So then to-night—
So thou my captive art? No doubt!
So thou with thy cold devil's fist
So thou'rt beginning on a smaller scale.
So very slowly she regain'd her strength.
So warm and happy,—free from all alarms;
So young a creature to beguile.
Soars as from prison.
Soft bloometh bud and bower!
Soldier, Students, &c.
Solvet saeclum in favilla.
Some feelings cling of baser quality;
Some further questions grant, I pray;
Some gnome her lover be! where cross-roads meet,
Some love-sick folk are sitting here!
Some old and precious parchment, at the sight
Some pleasures gratis to enjoy,
Some present for my love procure!
Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you may have other legal rights.
Some tit-bits by our cunning;
Some token of the angel bring!
Something unmaidenly or bold hath seen?
Songs shall salute thine ear,
Sore then your trials and severe;
Sorrow and grief are ours.
Sorrow revives, her wail of anguish sending
Sound understanding, judgment true,
Sounds plausible, yet I'm not reconciled;
Spare me! What harm have I e'er done to thee?
Spare not at all, nor birds, nor beast.
Speak frankly, sir, none is there you have met?
Speak of one all o'ermastering passion,—
Spider's foot and midge's wing,
Spill not a single drop, of this beware! (They drink repeatedly.)
Spin for their eyes abundant occupation,
Spirit of contradiction! Lead! I'll follow straight!
Spirit sublime! Thou gav'st me, gav'st me all
Spirit! I dare not lift me to thy sphere.
Spirits alike and spirit from his brain.
Spirits are thronging.
Spirits of evil! what dost thou require?
Spirits! I feel you hov'ring near;
Spirits, I plainly to your face declare:
Spirits, if present, grace the scene,
Spreadeth the flood;
Spring weaves already in the birchen trees;
Sputters forth sparks of drizzling fire.
Stagnate sap of life and sense.
Stand at the wash-tub early; forthwith go
Standing far off, a lone child, pale and fair?
Stars from whose tender beam
Stars, your soft radiance shed,
Stay without and follow none!
Stay! stay!
Steeds, servants, carriage, where are they?
Stem we the rolling surge of chance!
Step forth! I do adjure thee thus!
Stick close! else we shall severed be.
Still as I ply the critic's task, I feel
Still at thy back alert and prompt to be;
Still brighter here!
Still clench'd in malice impotent
Still early on my feet and late;
Still for the fond illusion yearns my soul?
Still forward press, nor ever tire!
Still here! what arrogance! unheard of quite!
Still in broad daylight, ere the clock strikes four,
Still is he here!
Still is she wont some new disguise to wear,
Still is the master near,
Still let the Prince of lies, without control,
Still makes the best of things; I know
Still prosecute your paltry game,
Still striveth towards its native shores.
Still thou remainest ever, what thou art.
Still to watch on I had been well content,
Still trail their curse from race to race,
Still where the currents wind,
Still yearning for the truth, hath sought the light of day.
Stinging tobacco,—these I love the best.
Stoop hither from your golden atmosphere,
Stoop thy maternal brow,
Stoop thy maternal brow,
Stop,
Stop, gentlemen, nor pass me by,
Straight for a priest the mother sent,
Stream forth the masses, in bright array.
Streameth a raving magic-song!
Stretch o'er the infinite her wing sublime,
Stretch'd on my pallet languish in despair,
Stretching many a wondrous band,
Strewn broadcast, sputter sparks of light:
Strike boldly in the chorus, clear and strong!
Strike home! The fellow is fair game, I trow!
Striping with sleet the verdant plains;
Strong beer, a damsel smartly dress'd,
Strong drink to sip is our desire;
Success alone; I still am far behind.
Success and failure, as they can,
Such a commission scares me not,
Such a domestic is a dangerous guest.
Such a reproof disturbs me not a whit!
Such be the fate of every flea!
Such benefit can draw! The sire
Such is his mode of seeking consolation;
Such is the joy that seasons paths like these!
Such sorry things to plague is nothing worth.
Such tricks a second time he'd better show!
Such various minds the bard alone can sway,
Suck from your work their melancholy food;
Suit hags, there's no gainsaying;
Sun, moon, and stars in sport would puff away.
Sunward they're steering;
Support thyself upon the simplest fare,
Suppose there did! One must not be too nice.
Sure I'm demented if the I
Sure and fast!
Swaying to rapture every listener's soul,
Sweep round the ample world with every sense,
Sweeping the, wreck-strewn precipice,
Sweeps down the dread abyss with desperate shock?
Sweet angel, with thy face of heavenly bliss!
Sweet choir! are ye the hymn of comfort singing,
Sweet folk, give ground!
Sweet love!
Sweet one! my meaning do not misconceive!
Sweet words and kisses came anon—
Swift dart the shuttles to and fro,
Swift in the circle they advanced,
Swiftly past us are retreating,
Sylphide!

Tail, talons, horns, are nowhere to be traced!
Take heed, let nothing dissipate your mind.
Take me with you! Oh take me too!
Take proper heed, the tailor strictly charge,
Take the whisk and sit down in the settle!
Take thirty winters from my frame?
Teach me to know my kindred. And when roars
Tear follows tear, my steadfast heart obeying
Tell me, stand we motionless,
Tell me, to what doth all this tend?
Tell me, ye whelps, accursed crew!
Tempests and earthquakes, fire and flood, I've tried;
Ten thousand greetings to my love.
Tender and fair.
Th' attempt I fear can ne'er succeed;
Than burden'd by that little here to sweat and groan!
Than chatting about war and war's alarms,
Than here in the New Testament.
Than in disturbing thus my hours of joy.
Than mortal eye hath e'er beheld before.
Than others we might make more show indeed;
Than the world's wisdom or the sage's lore.
Than thou could'st compass in the bound
Thanks and prosperity to each!
Thanks for your fair salute.
That 'tis your most appropriate sphere is certain.
That 'twill a singular effect produce.
That Death is never quite a welcome guest.
That I a good-night strain to them should give.
That I more angry could not feel with you.
That I my anxious zeal may prove,
That I no more, with aching brow,
That I the force may recognise
That I'm a genius she must needs allow,
That I'm the very devil perhaps she feels.
That all he utters standeth in the book;
That all these visionary shapes
That betimes we may appear
That binds creation's inmost energies;
That charm in which she's parallel'd by few;
That comes of being proud, methinks;
That every drop within its round,
That flowers and fruit will deck the coming years.
That folk are ripe for doomsday, now one sees;
That ghosts stand not on ordinary feet?
That he retained them to his blessed end.
That he the good and fair misprizes—
That he with naught on earth can sympathize is clear;
That he's a villain my conviction's strong.
That her dead husband's limbs, outstretch'd, repose
That hither, thither, crowd upon my brain,
That in my heart like fire doth burn.
That in this hallow'd precinct reigns!
That is not fair!
That is the bosom I so fondly press'd,
That law, alas, none careth to discern.
That lies in the triple-glowing light!
That my sweet Gretchen's form, so oft caress'd!
That my two gentlemen are nobly born,
That none may miracles believe, who now will say?
That on 'twill circumspectly creep,
That on the waters bright
That poets sometimes are sincere.
That rigid look of hers doth freeze man's blood,
That scarcely more to do doth now remain.
That she beneath her arm her head can bear,
That she the likeness of my Gretchen wears.
That soon the sweet young creature may
That such too in my garden grow.
That the marriage golden be,
That there must needs therein be something to conceive.
That there was not much blessing there.
That they have tender hearts and true,
That they will let us join them presently.
That things may then their course pursue,
That thou art not a Christian.
That thus the throng of spirits disappear?
That thy poor Gretchen thou hast known too well.
That time bath not yet come for me.
That to his heart no living soul is dear.
That too!
That two she feedeth when she eats and drinks.
That up fire-ladders tall and steep,
That was a rapture, gracious and sweet!
That was my lov'd one's voice!
That we elect a pope I now suggest.
That we in truth can nothing know!
That we may tender, filial-wise,
That we once more athirst should lie?
That well with you her potion may agree.
That what life is you may essay.
That which the hour creates, that can it use alone!
That worthily thy leisure to beguile,
That written on his brow was seen—
That you are master here it obvious quite;
That you in your profession take the lead:
That you to friendly counsel should attend.
That you're an amateur one plainly sees!
That youth's plump blooming cheek I very much prefer.
That's not enough, we must ourselves believe!
That, meteor-like, dissolves in air.
The All-embracer,
The Alpine slope, beside the waters wild,
The Christ is not here.
The Church alone, be it confessed,
The Church bath a good stomach, she, with zest,
The French your genuine German hates with all his heart,

The Project Gutenberg Etext of Faust Part 1, by Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe #32 in our series by Goethe
The acre thou dost reap, thyself to dung;
The active, the beneficent!
The air grows chill, the mists descend!
The ancient one I like sometimes to see,
The bagpipe doth unite them.
The beautiful world
The beauty that's gone!
The best place give to my mother,
The bloodstain'd wreath in conquest's dazzling hour;
The boisterous guests, I feel, are coming straight.
The bolt I fain would leave undrawn for thee;
The bonds which imprison
The brook along,
The buxom damsel turn'd her head,
The caldron dost neglect, for shame!
The calm sublimity of gods can feel;
The captur'd prize was shared among the crew
The cheat of glory, deathless fame!
The chimney, too, may serve thy need.
The circle narrows, he's already near!
The clanking chains, the rustling straw, to hear.
The compact! I at once will undertake
The cook laid poison for the guest,
The courses of the stars unroll'd;
The crooked leaps, the clumsy hops,
The crowd doth gather, in silence it rolls;
The crowd's applause assumes a scornful tone.
The crown of our humanity to gain,
The crown to lime!
The culture, too, that shapes the world, at last
The dainty wrist;—and how to press,
The darling was to me so dear.
The darling's sorrow grieves me, bring
The day before me, and behind the night,
The day of judgment too will soon appear!
The devil fights for you!
The devil is an egoist I know:
The devil taught her, it is true;
The devil! thou hast hands and feet,
The devil's in the house and can't escape.
The devil's presence, was it but a dream?
The devils roar!
The doctor cleaveth still to thee.
The doctor?
The door's ajar, the passage clear;
The drama was given to the public first as a fragment in 1790; then the completed First Part appeared in 1808; and finally the Second Part was published in 1833, the year after the author's death. Writing in "Dichtung und Wahrheit" of the period about 1770, when he was in Strasburg with. Herder, Goethe says, "The significant puppet-play legend . . . echoed and buzzed in many tones within me. I too had drifted about in all knowledge, and early enough had been brought to feel the vanity of it. I too had made all sorts of experiments in life, and had always come back more unsatisfied and more tormented. I was now carrying these things, like many others, about with me and delighting myself with them in lonely hours, but without writing anything down." Without going into the details of the experience which underlies these words, we can see the be ginning of that sympathy with the hero of the old story that was the basis of its fascination and that accounted for Goethe's departure from the traditional catastrophe of Faust's damnation.
The earthly lost in beatific vision,
The easy manners that insure success;
The embryo angel here unfold.
The end of that sore plague, with many a tear,
The essence must I see of heavenly grace?
The evil one's existence.
The fatal sickness stay'd at last.
The few who somewhat of these things have known,
The field, heaven knows, is all too wide!
The fiery blood of Italy,
The first being so, and so the second,
The first she everywhere must shine,
The first to choose; as to the second, slaves are we.
The first, methinks, was no great thing.
The fleetness of the hind,
The flood-tide of my spirit ebbs away;
The flower-pots at my window
The fragments abroad by a demigod scatter'd!
The gallant with the cloven foot!
The gallant you, I'll cater for your pleasure.
The garden, then, behind my house, we'll name,
The gather'd treasure of man's thought in vain;
The gayest gallants of the night,
The gems put on quite privately;
The gentleman is far too good—
The gentleman is surely pleas'd to jest!
The gentleman to shame me stoops thus low.
The gentlemen and ladies
The glorified their faces turn
The glorious Walpurgis night!
The god, who throned within my breast resides,
The gorgeous brede of figures, quaintly wrought,
The gorges of the gulf below!
The graves I will describe to thee,
The graves are shaken!
The great and little world you study through,
The greatest and most representative expression of Goethe's powers is without doubt to be found in his drama of "Faust"; but before dealing with Goethe's masterpiece, it is worth while to say something of the history of the story on which it is founded—the most famous instance of the old and widespread legend of the man who sold his soul to the devil. The historical Dr. Faust seems to have been a self-called philosopher who traveled about Germany in the first half of the sixteenth century, making money by the practise of magic, fortune-telling, and pretended cures. He died mysteriously about 1540, and a legend soon sprang up that the devil, by whose aid he wrought his wonders, had finally carried him off. In 1587 a life of him appeared, in which are attributed to him many marvelous exploits and in which he is held up as an awful warning against the excessive desire for secular learning and admiration for antique beauty which characterized the humanist movement of the time. In this aspect the Faust legend is an expression of early popular Protestantism, and of its antagonism to the scientific and classical tendencies of the Renaissance.
The greeting she shall have from me,
The ground beneath me ne'er before
The hag doth as in fever rave.
The half are cold, the half are rude.
The half-witted sot!
The hand on Saturday the mop that plies,
The heath's wide regions cover ye
The holy Roman empire now,
The hose quite smooth and not too large!
The hour still punctually observe!
The house with rage he scratch'd and gnaw'd,
The howling storm-blast through the groaning wood,
The hut becomes a paradise through thee!
The ignis fatuus they track out,
The impetuous millions to the devil ride;
The import of this primal sentence weigh,
The index then may cease its round,
The infant takes not kindly to the breast,
The inward essence from the name we read,
The joy austere of contemplative thought.
The key of Solomon is good.
The kitchen he invaded,
The lamp is quench'd—
The leafy palace, green for aye:
The liberty I took that day,
The life of gods,—how am I punish'd now!
The lightness of my nature; true,
The lion's magnanimity,
The little world, and then the great we'll view.
The little world-god still the self-same stamp retains,
The live-long day, for you I toil and fret;
The loathsome birth men fain would slay;
The lofty power
The lofty still they honour, the illusive love.
The loss my certain death would prove.
The love of man doth sway us wholly,
The loveliness of earth, is mirror'd here!
The lovely images they bring,
The man who comes with thee, I hate,
The master of the rats and mice,
The master then indeed I needs must play.
The meaning of each hallow'd sign.
The message well I hear, my faith alone is weak;
The mild procession of thy day.
The mind's spontaneous acts, till now
The mirror of eternal truth unveil'd,
The modest truth I speak to thee.
The monkey! Is she gone?
The monster to confront, at first,
The moon conceals her light—
The more abhorrent to the sight,
The more she courts the day's pure light.
The murky troops of Hell!
The mysteries of nature view!
The nicest measurement to take,
The northern phantom from the scene hath pass'd,
The only pledge, must holy anguish prove,
The others reciprocally do the same, and raise their knives.)
The outcast am I not, unhoused, unblest,
The owlets flit in wild affright.
The pangs that rack me to the bone?
The pathless waves beneath, and over me the skies.
The pensive moon her light doth veil;
The pentagram thy peace doth mar?
The pillars of the wall
The plague of fire
The pleasant land of wine and minstrelsy.
The pleasure is not half so great,
The poisoner laugh'd, Ha! ha! quoth she,
The poor guitar! 'tis done for now.
The possible, with steadfast trust,
The posts are now erected, and the planks,
The power of hate, the energy of love,
The power of his eye,
The power which fashion'd youth and maid,
The powers of nature all around revealing.
The prayer hath heaven with favour crowned;
The prettiest maidens and the best of beer,
The primal Four,
The prospect fills me with dismay.
The puppet you can knead and mould
The pure white cover o'er the board to spread,
The queen and all her maidens
The question trifling seems from one,
The raging storm-blasts howl and hiss!
The rat's mishap hath tamed his nature;
The road is not a pleasant one.
The roots upriven, creak and moan!
The roughest he-goat fain would I bestride,
The same mad wag that you have ever been!
The same, my Henry, it must be.
The savage mountain, with its cavern'd side,
The scoff and the scorn of its devilish crew,
The scoffer is least wearisome to me.
The scope of all my energy
The scope of all my powers henceforth be this,
The shepherd for the dance was dress'd,
The shivered branches whirr and sigh,
The sieve would show,
The silence of the grave now broods around!
The silver brooklets meeting golden streams.
The six days' labour of a god, my friend,
The sky-lark, lost in azure light,
The smile of his lip,
The snare hast entered of thine own free will:
The something—it subsisteth still;
The sorry trash in which these coxcombs deal,
The soul dilating to a deity;
The souls to whom my earlier lays I sang;
The space is narrow, nothing green,
The speaker in delivery will find
The spell of Four must be rehears'd;
The spirit I, which evermore denies!
The spirit aids! from anxious scruples freed,
The spirit's fond imaginings destroy.
The spoiler's lies, His arts despise,
The squares, the streets,
The staff is broken,—the death-bell tolls,—
The story of Medusa thou hast known.
The stoutest at the wedding!
The stubble is yellow, the corn is green;
The sweet young innocent! (aloud)
The sword in thy pierced heart,
The tailor to him goes:
The tear-drop flows,—Earth, I am thine again!
The tedious hours meanwhile you may employ,
The tender impulse, loses its control;
The tender souls, who love the melting mood,
The third and fourth deduc'd we see;
The thirst for truth, joy in each fond illusion.
The time already I discern,
The tones of his voice, sweet and loving, I knew.
The torturing woe,
The trinkets night and day thinks o'er,
The trouble's small, the sport is rare.
The trumpet sounds!
The tumult in my spirit healing,
The twin-pair that among the roses feed.
The vales reposing, every height a-glow,
The vaulted roof
The very best society they shun,
The very best that thou dost know
The very means how hardly are they won,
The wanton butterflies!
The way is broad, the way is long;
The which you gentlemen will surely keep?
The while I pluck'd these blossoms,
The while, with brimming glass, I spoke;
The whole witch chorus follows anon.
The wind is hushed, the stars grow pale,
The wish and purpose of your heart obey;
The wizard-foot doth me retain.
The woe of earth, the bliss of earth to bear,
The woman seems expressly made
The woman's scent is keen enough;
The wooden board yields wine as good.
The word its life resigneth in the pen,
The world behold;
The world to me
The worst society is some relief,
The wrecks into nothingness!
Thee and thine apes a stunning blow?
Thee hence by force I needs must bear.
Thee of thy foolish whims I've cured,
Thee to his boy with reverence shows;
Thee, me, himself?
Their colours the motly throng supply.
Their flight on rapture-breathing pinions winging,
Their golden buckets ceaseless interchange!
Their hands to thee!
Their jovial humour showing;
Their last upon mine anguish gaze!
Their one note are repeating.
Their places taken, they, with eyebrows rais'd,
Their tears, their laughter, you command with ease,
Their thousands ahs and ohs,
Their tones of bliss,
Their troop familiar, streaming through the air,
Their troth thus newly plighted!
Their use and might,
Their wings I envy not the feather'd kind;
Them hath a priest now made his own!—
Them in the street I cannot wear,
Then I have neither goods nor treasure,
Then I repeat, Come in!
Then alight ye on the ground;
Then are the lifeless fragments in his hand,
Then at our ball, what doth he here?
Then bear them far asunder;
Then became I a wood-bird, and sang on the spray,
Then better 'twere that naught should be.
Then call it, what thou wilt,—
Then come alternate rapture and despair;
Then deathless constancy thou'lt swear;
Then drain the goblet at one draught profound,
Then first the full power of the bass is known.
Then follow to yon rosy height,
Then forward steps your sage to show,
Then from durance is he freed!
Then from thy service thou art free,
Then give me back youth's golden prime,
Then gratulate the king and queen,
Then hurled the hallow'd goblet
Then in the heart itself that knoweth,
Then is it needful cunning words to seek?
Then joyful we at eve come home again,
Then many a day they'll teach you how
Then may my life that instant cease!
Then may the solemn death-bell sound,
Then may thy son a higher goal achieve.
Then mayst thou fetter me straightway,
Then must I too, when falls the veil of night,
Then noble idleness I thee will teach to prize,
Then parry that!
Then rich in hope, with faith sincere,
Then saw I—
Then scale these rocks, whence, in eternal spray,
Then shadowy mist the world conceal'd,
Then shalt thou do the same for me.
Then she will ne'er let go her clasp,
Then should I see the world below,
Then smiling I my beard would stroke,
Then stand abash'd, when thou perforce must own,
Then suitable occasions we must seize,
Then the safe gate securely pass'd,
Then they sing songs about me,—'tis wicked of the throng—
Then thou dost lead me to some shelter'd cave,
Then thou dost not believe?
Then thou may'st question at thy leisure.
Then though good wine is not forthcoming here,
Then to the abyss will I depart!
Then to the devil with the singer too!
Then truly, 'tis a sight to grieve the soul!
Then was his heart with pangs oppress'd,
Then was the genuine age of gold,
Then we the witch must summon after all.
Then were the noisy boasters dumb.
Then why not I in mine?
Then why one wakes, one knows aright!
Then will your mind be so well braced,
Then winter nights grow cheerful; keen delight
Then with her lover she must chat,
Then would celestial love, with holy kiss,
Then youth's fair blossoms crowd to view your play,
Then, pensive friend! o'er book and scroll,
Thence both, while open flames around them roll'd,
Thence only impotent icy grains
There I peep'd in an owlet's nest.
There could not be a fonder fool than mine,
There for remembrance fondly stored,
There fragments lie.
There is some sense in that! one sees the how and why.
There lies the glass!
There lies the slime!
There may alternate weal and woe,
There must be some disorder in thy wit!
There only fails, alas the spirit-band.
There see that you profoundly comprehend,
There sit a pair, the old one with the young;
There sits my mother upon a stone,
There sits my mother upon a stone—
There they may scatter one another's brains,
There too the pleasant garden shade,
There was a king in Thule,
There we'll await you both this evening.
There! Now the lubber's tamed!
There's blood thereon.
There's honour and instruction too;
There's now no help for it. I'll step before
There's now no walking on our feet,
There's something wrong about it; much I fear
There,
Therefore in bringing out your play,
Therefore in time, dear sir, reflect, I pray.
Therefore myself to magic I give,
Therein I saw a rifted tree.
Therein I saw an apple-tree,
Therein some trifles I have placed,
Thereto a perfect right hast thou.
Thereto thou lengthen'd respite hast!
These be my prey!
These fellows would not scent the devil out,
These hills and peaceful vales among,
These our scenes;—so we, to-day,
These splendid gems, whose may they be?
These that I'm hitting off to-day
These the sage doctor knows,
These walls, this melancholy room,
They are about to recommence;—the play
They are but mountebanks, I'll lay a bet!
They bind and seize me!
They charm, they strew.
They crowd and jostle, whirl and flutter!
They dance, they talk, they cook, make love, and drink:
They danced to right, to left they danced,
They drive impetuous from the frozen north,
They footed it right merrily. Juchhe! Juchhe!
They from the south heap fire upon the brain,
They glimmer, sparkle, stink and flare—
They have flown up there.
They hear me not my later cadence singing,
They live and let live, hence it is but meet.
They look dissatisfied and full of scorn.
They pined away, I yet must live,
They press around, inquire, advance,
They rail and scuffle, scream and fight!
They roar as by the evil one possess'd,
They say
They stoutly keep protesting!
They think, if pliant there, us too he will obey.
They took it from me but to give me pain,
They walk demurely, yet you'll see,
They whisper, babble, twirl, and splutter!
They with a thousand steps may do it;
They're in their glory, mark their elevation!
They're off a journey, that is clear,—
They're soaring, swooping, betiding, stooping.
They, as it seems, stand well with you!
Thine aspect to the powers supernal
Thine earthly breast in the morning-red!"
Thine own dear hand!—But how is this? 'Tis wet?
Things now assume another shape,
Think too for whom you write, I pray!
Think! only think! The gems for Gretchen brought,
Think'st to provoke me! I have caught thee now!
Thinking the hours too brief for their Sweet talk;
Thinking to push, thyself art push'd along.
This Easter hymn in days of old;
This cant about posterity I hate;
This chain—how would it look on me!
This displeases you? "For shame!"
This earth the fountain whence my pleasures flow,
This eats into my heart; with thee
This entity's a dreadful bore,
This eve, at neighbour Martha's, her you'll meet again;
This fiddling, shouting, skittling, I detest;
This girl must win for me! Dost hear?
This hour enjoyment more intense,
This is antipathy!
This is the best method, credit me,
This is the everlasting song
This is the people's paradise.
This is the utterance of the human heart;
This is the witch's one-time-one!
This is thy world! a world! alas!
This life intense, this godlike ecstasy—
This loathsome cheat, this senseless stuff
This minstrelsy of yours I must repay,—
This mortal spirit from his primal source;
This must thou ken:
This narrow life would suit me not at all.
This ne'er the less won't always do.
This once I must admit your plea;—
This once permission to retire.
This process, chemists name, in learned thesis,
This senseless, juggling witchcraft I detest!
This sun doth daily shine upon my woe,
This task is yours, old gentlemen, to-day;
This then the kernel of the brute!
This token of your favour!
This too from thee? The death and downfall of a world be on thee, monster I Conduct me thither, I say, and set her free!
This was our medicine; the patients died,
This, Sir, a second time you need not say!
This, may in truth be called a fair!
This, scholars of all countries prize,—
Thither I will not go, I loathe the place.
Thither doth call us,
Thither the gathering legions fly,
Those I have lost become realities to me.
Thou art a good kind-hearted man,
Thou art and dost remain liar and sophist too.
Thou art not yet the man to hold the devil fast!—
Thou canst! But will it!
Thou com'st for me at midnight-hour.
Thou dar'st not to the striplings show.
Thou dost forgive my boldness, dost not blame
Thou dost permit me in her depths profound,
Thou dost thy matters ill;
Thou dost with bitter smart,
Thou dread'st to see her face once more?
Thou from this sphere must soon have vanished.
Thou gav'st me this companion, unto whom
Thou happy creature!
Thou has not won the life-restoring draught.
Thou hast destroy'd
Thou hellish pest,
Thou hollow skull, that grin, what should it say,
Thou honourest not the sacraments, alas!
Thou knowest, thou alone!
Thou lingerest at the fatal door,
Thou monster, does not see that this
Thou must perspire, in order that the juice
Thou must! Thou must! Though life should be the fee!
Thou nam'st thyself a part, and yet a whole I see.
Thou now shalt hear.
Thou see'st me also now among thy train.
Thou seest that mine is no idle threat.
Thou shalt live!
Thou speak'st to him, he fawns upon thee straight;
Thou standest still, for thee he'll wait;
Thou too must die!
Thou under-signest merely with a drop of blood.
Thou whom mortality,
Thou wilt awake the jailor with thy cry!
Thou wilt not wrest me from her with levers and with screws.
Thou wilt strike off my chain,
Thou wouldst be fiend enough to envy me my joy.
Thou wretched beldame, void of shame!
Thou'lt common be to all the town.
Thou'lt dance no more with spirits light!
Thou'lt revel through thy gay career!
Thou'rt after all—just what thou art.
Thou'rt free to do so! Gladly I'll attend;
Thou'rt leaving me?
Thou'rt like the spirit, thou dost comprehend,
Thou'rt right indeed; no traces now I see
Thou, 'mongst the Sons of earth,
Thou, Nature, didst in vision bright,
Thou, restless spirit, dost from end to end
Though I am wont indeed to strict incognito,
Though all the circle look on me with scorn;
Though danger threaten thee, to sink in endless sleep!
Though flowers are lacking, varied of dye,
Though folly's microcosm, man, it seems,
Though in perplexity he serves me now,
Though not at the dance—
Though not omniscient, much to me is known.
Though scarce n living creature.
Though spirits, yet their limbs, we know,
Though the foregoing enumeration contains but a selection front the titles of Goethe's best known writings, it suffices to show the extraordinary fertility and versatility of his genius. Rarely has a man of letters had so full and varied a life, or been capable of so many-sided a development. His political and scientific activities, though dwarfed in the eyes of our generation by his artistic production, yet showed the adaptability of his talent in the most diverse directions, and helped to give him that balance of temper and breadth of vision in which he has been surpassed by no genius of the ancient or modern world.
Though to be sure I fain would seize,
Though youthful phantasy, while hope inspires,
Thought's beaten track securely keep,
Three centuries I climb in vain,
Three years! how brief the appointed tide!
Thrice be the words express'd.
Thro' the chimney and away!
Throng not the naked beauty!
Through dew and exhalation;
Through ether's calm dominions!
Through every nerve and vein with ardour glowing.
Through garden and field how spread the throng,
Through me there runs a shuddering—
Through nature's veins, and, still creating, know
Through numberless receipts to blend.
Through reverence, I hope I may subdue
Through scenes of vapid dulness, where at last
Through the death-sleep I now depart
Through the dream and magic-sphere
Through the gracious spring-tide's all-quickening glow;
Through the heath and through the moss!
Through the stones and heather springing,
Through the wild sphere their chimes melodious ringing!
Throughout the heavenly sphere,
Thrust home!
Thus all the elements which ye
Thus at the breasts of wisdom day by day
Thus draws the goblet from my lips away?
Thus let creation's ample sphere
Thus one has quite another air.
Thus pious gentlemen appear
Thus says the witch,
Thus should it stand: yet, while the line I trace.
Thus through my limbs already burns
Thus time's whirring loom unceasing I ply,
Thus to converse so learnedly with you.
Thus totter'd to perplex me.
Thus we shall have our pleasure too.
Thus you the best elixir brew,
Thus you will ne'er stray widely from the goal;
Thus, sir, unceasing travel is your lot?
Thy choice is free; to me 'tis all the same.
Thy comrade;— Should it suit thy need,
Thy fall the fatal death-stab gave.
Thy frame may penetrate through every part.
Thy glorious gifts to nothing, with a breath.
Thy heart by one sole impulse is possess'd;
Thy heart will sink in blank despair,
Thy lord and master dost thou know?
Thy love where hast thou left?
Thy mother's son.
Thy name?
Thy sense is shut, thy heart is dead!
Thy senses and thyself confine
Thy soul's deep love, in lover's fashion.
Thy steps through life forthwith wilt take;
Thy threshold a slight hindrance doth impede;
Thy vain imaginations banished,
Thy visage from the radiant sun to turn!
Thy whim I'll gratify, howe'er absurd.
Thy worthy avocation now I guess!
Thyself at the master's feet now lay!
Till self-reproach away I cast,—
Time only makes the subtle ferment strong.
Time three Archangels come forward
Time's short, art long; methinks 'twere fit
Time, my good friend, will all that's needful give;
Tiny step and lofty bound,
Tip and sway!
Title: Faust Part 1
To Being's depths would penetrate alone.
To God, a soldier true and brave.
To Hell I'd jump and leave them.
To Him above in homage bend,

To all that sorrow feel
To ancient hills succeeding,—
To and fro,
To bare my breast to every pang,—to know
To be unveil'd by force she doth refuse,
To be with my kindred I am fain.
To blast the stedfast rocks;
To blend high aims and cunning low;
To charm mankind, and edify them too.
To charm thee with mine arts. I'll give thee more
To comfort the enamour'd child,
To condescend to come this way,

To cut the matter short, my friend,
To dancing booth and village fair!
To deal with witches this is still the way.
To distant spheres of pure activity.
To do your will, I'll cordially essay;
To don at once the same costume,
To drive the pimp and gipsy's trade.
To ecstasy the feeling grew!
To empty trash who clings, with zeal untired,
To fable-books it now doth appertain;
To fall in love by rule and plan!
To feel him near;
To feel how tightly it is laced.
To fish I am delighted;
To forms I've always been attached indeed,
To forms material he adhereth still;
To fright us at our revel;—
To give oneself up wholly and to feel
To glad the earnest guests was thine,

To govern than the Muses!
To grasp in thought the lofty and the deep,
To hear on what your wisdom grounds your views?
To hear the reckless murderers blest.
To help the poor his life prolong!
To her it will not harmful prove?
To her of bliss
To her the hours seem miserably long;
To him I wot,
To hip their elbow bringing.
To his neck will I fly,
To hurry to enjoyment straight?
To introduce us, do you purpose here
To join our mirthful throng to-day.
To kiss thou couldst so soon forget!
To let me go my mother was not fain;
To lie in darkness on the dewy height,
To loose the bonds of wretchedness and woe.
To market, and then mind the cooking too—
To me the swiftest of thy pinions lend!
To me this branch of science is well known,
To me thy countenance in flaming fire:
To me, thou son of hell, explain,
To mingle in the world I want address;
To mock the questioner.
To more restraints we must submit;
To my last words give heed! (All gather round him.)
To my rapt vision opes its ample tide!
To nature's portals ye should be the key;
To nestle beside thee so lovingly,
To nonsense, reason's self they turn;
To offer you my arm and company?
To ope the ancient text an impulse strong
To part from one so crazy, harsh, and cross,
To perfect grace, her godlike form,
To play the spy diverts you then?
To raise the casket with its treasure;
To rank itself with us, the spirits, heaved?
To rave thus like a madman, is it fit?
To reach it, say, what means must I employ?
To reach the hard-won goal inciteth;
To read, of even moderate sense?
To rule the Roman empire, that you were not born!
To satisfy them—that's a harder task.
To say: I believe him not?
To see in times before us how a wise man thought,
To see me thou dost breathe thine invocation,
To see once more the gallant Satan here!
To see thee in such odious company.
To shores unknown allures a brighter day.
To show how lightly life may glide away;
To shudder not at yonder dark abyss,
To smash her window-panes will be!
To snare the wanderer! 'Neath our tread,
To snatch at joy while on the wing,
To speak so kindly even to the devil.
To strange conceits oft I myself must own,
To stratagem we must resort.
To strew the crisping sand beneath thy tread.
To suit the puppets and their mimic stage.
To sum up all—To words hold fast!
To swell the mighty choir in unison?
To take each other's life, I trow,
To take her to his home, a lovely bride!
To the dear God on high,
To the hunting-lodge we're on our way.
To the left, where the plank is,
To the seat of blood already I'm bound!
To the wood beyond,
To thee, thy soul shall rise, and seek
To their heart's depths more surely thus appealing.
To these will follow many a stave.
To thine own chime!
To think of you I shall have many an hour.
To thrust thee 'mid the vulgar throng.
To triumph over bards and devils too.
To try theology I feel inclined.
To turn me from that piteous look away.
To tutor me a better course to lead.
To us must yield.
To us, my friend, the ages that are pass'd
To whom his dying mistress
To work! The point that holds me bound
To work, then! Give a master-piece, my friend;
To yon calm spirit-realm uplifts my soul;
To you a glass I joyfully will give.
To you is known what we require,
To-day he will not be alone, he said
To-day we pass'd him, but we did not stop!
To-morrow like to-day, the whole year through.
To-morrow sees undone, what happens not to-day
To-morrow, in all honour, thou
To-morrow:
To-night who flies not, never flies.
To-night, I see, I shall in naught succeed;
To-whit! To-whoo! It sounds more near;
Together here collected!
Together verses it can string,
Tokay
Too lovely was that female form!
Too old the trifler's part to play,
Too well, my humble prattle never can
Too young to live by no desire possess'd.
Tooth of rat the way must clear.
Torn lies the garland, the fair blossoms strew'd.
Tortures itself and thee
Touching his cousins, and to each he sent
Touching the ling'ring chords of childlike feeling,
Touching their lover's faith and creed,
Touching these matters, it must be confess'd,
Touching these things all men would something know.
Towards Italy without delay,
Towards all beside I have a kindly mood;
Towards which my every sense doth strain?
Towards yonder stars that gleam,
Traffic and duty urge us! With what pain
Transcending thought, the works eternal
Transpierced with nail and spear!
Tread it with right good will!
Trees on trees, a stalwart legion,
Trembles and throbs, its yearning grief
Trembles into life!
Trembles, a crush'd and writhing worm!
True even to the grave;
True friends whom I so oft have found,
True, they are not accustomed to the best,
Turn thee around, and from this height,
Two beauteous apples charmed mine eyes;
Two girls, well-dress'd, are drawing near;
Two meet by chance, are pleased, they linger there,
Two souls, alas! are lodg'd within my breast,
Unceasingly roll'd,
Unconscious of the other still remain!
Under the threshold there,
Undine!
Undo the bolt! in silly night,
Undo the bolt! the lover wakes.
Unhappy Faust! I know thee now no more.
Unless indeed the yawning ground
Unmannerly beast!
Unseen the threads together flow,
Unsought it is reveal'd.
Unspeakable, diffused
Until at length with perfect form 'tis crowned;
Until his paunch became as fat
Unto thy lov'd one's chamber thou
Unveil thyself!
Up scholar, lave, with zeal undying,
Up stood the jovial monarch,
Up then, from idle pondering free,
Up! Forth into the distant land!
Up! or you're lost.
Up, down, across, and to and fro,
Upon her neck I fain would hang with joy;
Upon his brow 'tis legibly revealed,
Upon my elbows I would lean,
Upon my neck it strikes with sudden shock.
Upon such terms, to you I swear,
Upon the spot I should be dead.
Upon the spot myself I'll make
Upon your honoured brow to heap;
Upward the eddying concourse throng;
Upwards and onwards still to urge our flight,
Us novelties attract alone.
Us to frighten, us to seize;
Us unto darkness he hath brought, and here
Us, it appears, you do not know.
Usage or not, it happens so.
Use it, than brutes more brutish still to grow.
Use well your time, so rapidly it flies;

Vain hesitation! Babbling, quaking!
Vainly I have aspired too high;
Vainly he'll seek refreshment, anguish-tost,
Vales, where mists still shift and play,
Vanish from sight!
Vanish in the fiery glow,
Vanish; we now have fill'd the world with light!
Vapours are rising—
Viands and drink shall float his craving lips beyond—
Viewless, or visible to mortal ken,
Vile broomstick!
Vile reprobate! go get thee hence;
Vineyards! unless my sight deceives?
Virtue she hath, and modest heed,
Virtuous withal, I feel, with, I confess,
Visionary scenes appear!
Voices of those heavenly days—
Voices well trained in chorus pealing?
Vow deathless love.

Wait not the might
Waits on his growing powers;
Walking in public with these witches. True,
Wander they there;
Warms every limb; and ah! when we unroll
Was ever mortal spirit, in its high endeavour,
Was it a god who character'd this scroll,
Was it not given to thee and me—thee too?
Was that your nose?
Was then the youthful queen descried
Was't not enough, in thy delirious whirl
Water, and fire, and rocky heights,
Waters, he thirsteth not who once hath quaffed?
We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
We are planning on making some changes in our donation structure in 2000, so you might want to email me, hart@pobox.com beforehand.
We at the window stand, our glasses drain,
We can in peace and comfort bear away.
We counsel separation.
We court your imitation:
We find it not strange, that man despises
We gave my mother up for lost, she lay
We have on oath but duly to attest,
We hear and rhyme.
We heard erewhile, unless I'm wrong,
We must more cleverly proceed,
We need your donations more than ever!
We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work. The time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc. This projected audience is one hundred million readers. If our value per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2 million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text files per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+ If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.
We rag'd more fiercely than the pest;
We shall meet once more.
We speak and see!
We to chaste ears it seems must not pronounce
We took a Turkish vessel which conveyed
We towards the mill are strolling on.
We wash, and free from all stain are we,
We will consider what you say,
We will go hence with speed,
We would prefer to send you this information by email.
We'll speak of them when next we meet;
We're too well-bred to squabble here,
We've but to spread this mantle wide,
We, his true-hearted,
Weak as she was, 'twas vain for her to try
Weave one vast whole from Being's ample range!
Wedded ones, would ye agree,
Weighs down upon me I—air!
Welcom'd in joy and grief the ages flown!
Welcome sweet twilight, calm and blest,
Well done, my dainty spirits! now he slumbers!
Well pleased assembled here I view
Well spoken, I admit!
Well understood the noble trade;
Well! Well! I'll leave you to yourself with pleasure,
Well, he bath paid the forfeit, and is dead.
Well, to be brief, the joy as fit occasions rise,
Were bitten by the pest,
Were but the ear-rings only mine!
Were but your wine a trifle better, friend,
Were courtiers, rich and great.
Were not in truth a grievous loss.
Were tortur'd to another bridal bed.
Were we but only past the hill!
Were we surprised by her, ah me!
Were wet with tears of mine,
What 'tis that he can find in me.
What Do I not for thy dear sake!
What I can!
What I enjoy with relish sweet,
What I possess as from afar I see;
What Stir ye in the broth about?
What a man knows not, that he doth require,
What aileth thee? what chafes thee now so sore?
What ails thee? art enraptured or distressed?
What bliss! what torture! vainly I essay
What boots it to abridge a pleasant way?
What boots it to escape? They lurk for me!
What can the world to me afford?
What charming company I view
What constant work at home must I not do perforce!
What countless myriads have I swept away!
What dazzles, for the moment born, must perish;
What deed of shame
What do I see? what form, whose charms transcend
What doth my spirit to thy will constrain;
What doth the limit of man's brain transcend;
What dreams beguile you on your poet's height?
What e'er therein is promised thou shalt reap,
What every journeyman safe in his pouch will hoard
What feelings, great man, must thy breast inspire,
What foreign is one always can't decline,
What from the floor ascendeth like a ghost?
What fulness in this poverty!
What genuine is posterity will cherish.
What he conceives not;
What heaven contains would comprehend,
What hidden mystery in this riddle lies?
What holds me, that I deal not now
What hoots it to be young and fair?
What hum melodious, what clear silvery chime
What in the gloom thus moves you?
What in the spirit's depths was there created,
What in this moth-world doth my being bound?
What in your favour here began at once to plead;
What is to me heaven's joy within her arms?
What liquor can I serve you with, I pray?
What mad pursuit! What tumult wild!
What may occur just bear in mind!
What means the knave! For this you'll dearly pay!
What murmurest thou?
What nonsense doth the hag propound?
What pleases him, or what to let alone.
What promenades, what jaunts there were,
What prospect have we of success?
What puts a full house in a merry mood?
What she reveals not to thy mental sight,
What shyly there the lip shaped forth in sound;
What special faculty you choose?
What spectre have I harbour'd thus!
What stems there be! What grapes I see!
What stillness here environs me!
What sudden ecstasy of joy is flowing!
What super-earthly ecstasy! at night,
What take you now these travellers to be?
What then am I, if I aspire in vain
What think you of the charming creature?
What though my life her bosom warms!—
What though my power compell'd thee to appear,
What thoughts are thine?
What thus I hear
What voice of woe
What was it?
What we employ not, but impedes our way,
What we hope, and what we love!
What we possess in black and white,
What weave they yonder round the Ravenstone?
What will you do?
What wilt thou wager? Him thou yet shall lose,
What would he in this holy place?
What wouldest thou! She thinks you've taken flight;
What wouldst thou here? what makes thy heart so sore?
What! Oberon in beauteous step
What! shall the bard his godlike power abuse?
What! with the devil hand and glove,
What's done is past! what's past is done!
What's done, alas, is done and past!
What's good is often scatter'd far apart.
What's more, it doth no longer stink;
What's that to you?
What, all my truth, my love forgotten quite?
What, nathless, the chaste heart cannot renounce.
What, sir! with us your hocus-pocus play!
What, sorry Devil, hast thou to bestow?
What, there? without?
What?
Whate'er for them one may have done;
Whatever of a spirit's agency.

When buds the sapling, doth the gardener know
When death came, unrepining
When early in my chamber
When far above us pours its thrilling song
When foes in battle round are pressing,
When folk in Turkey, up in arms,
When formerly a perfect heaven of bliss
When from afar, the victor's crown,
When from my heart th' unbidden rhyme
When from the whirling dance, to drown
When in his study pent the whole year through,
When in its toils a youth she doth ensnare,
When in the garden first I came?
When infamy is newly born,
When last we met him he had much to say
When my own spirit too was growing,
When nature doth her thoughts unfold
When of scholastic forms you learn the use;
When on extended wing amain
When on firm basis we would them maintain.
When on what's good we may regale in peace.
When passion sways me, and I seek to frame
When seated 'mong the jovial crowd,
When such a head no issue sees,
When thee all honest folk will spurn,
When they shall look thee in the face!
When thou from church didst lately wend thy way?
When thou, still full of innocence,
When to the moment I shall say,
When we our bold excursion make,
When we ourselves were foremost in men's sight.
When will ye learn your hallow'ed worth to know!
When words men hear, in sooth, they usually believe.
When wreck'd our fortunes in the gulf of time.
Whence are ye come?
Whence comes his mastery o'er the human breast,
Whence o'er the elements his sway,
Whence sound the tidings of great joy;
Whence this mild radiance that around me plays,
Where I and Martha for thy coming stay'd.
Where am I? What a beauteous land!
Where are the fetters? where the dungeon's gloom?
Where are the murderers? are they fled?
Where art thou, Faust? whose voice I heard resound,
Where art thou?
Where beggars vile and cripples hide,
Where could we find aught better, do you think?
Where day and night alternate, is your sphere.
Where either pleasure
Where he with oil has smear'd it.—Thou
Where heaven's dear light itself doth pass,
Where him I have not,
Where in the country will you find,
Where in their leafy bower
Where is he? I heard him calling me.
Where is the breast, which in its depths a world conceiv'd
Where is the fellow? Could I scent him out,
Where leeches, feasting on his rump, will drain
Where love and friendship yield their choicest blessing,
Where merry comrades boasting loud
Where only for the bard blooms pure delight,
Where phantasy creates her own self-torturing brood,
Where reign'd the mortal pestilence.
Where riot still grows louder;
Where shall I grasp thee, infinite nature, where?
Where soft breezes whisper
Where the first time I caught a glimpse of thee.
Where the four winds have blown it, who can say?
Where they stole in, there they must forth. We're free
Where thou dost pass they stand in rows,
Where waters troubled are or clear,
Where will these frantic gestures end?
Where yet we dare not once remain!
Where, how, and when my husband died and was interr'd.
Wherefore from dripping stones and moss with ooze embued,
Wherefore thy passion so excite
Wherefore, ye tones celestial, sweet and strong,
Wherein the shreds of human thought ye twist,
Wherein, distorted oft, the times are glass'd.
Wherewith another to obtain.
Wherewith my lovely girl to deck?
Wherewith the spirit girds itself around!
Whether the thing is holy or profane,
Which ever flies, and flying springs,
Which he who quaff'd must first in rhyme expound,
Which lifts me near and nearer to the gods,
Which nowhere burns with purer beauty blent,
Which once around the darkness of the grave,
Which scarce can you discern from medicine.
Which still, with froward captiousness, impains
Which struggle there for undivided reign:
Which there was no fond loving hand to close.
Which to the high vault's topmost bound,
Which to the world, and to mankind,
Which unrestrain'd still presses on for ever,
Which way didst come?
Which we with sparkling drink have crown'd,
Which, as on dust it feeds, its native fare,
Which, vulture-like, consumes thee in this den.
Which?
While a succession of Faust books were appearing in Germany, the original life was translated into English and dramatized by Marlowe. English players brought Marlowe's work back to Germany, where it was copied by German actors, degenerated into spectacular farce, and finally into a puppet show. Through this puppet show Goethe made acquaintance with the legend.
While all around lie fair and verdant meads.
While bright with stars the heavens appear,
While ever waning, fades the glimmering light,
While far ahead the women keep,
While fresh upon my legs, so long I naught require,
While hollow thunder from the hill resounds;
While idle compliments you round,
While it your present thirst allays,
While low realities and paltry cares
While no sick-headache they bewail,
While on the grassy plain
While she, within her lowly cot, which graced
While through the desolate abyss,
While to its goal, the verse along
While we can warm our paws she'll stay.
While your love-rapture o'er creation flows,—
While, fraught with solemn meaning and mysterious
Whisp'ring of heaven's weal,
Whistling through wither'd leaves and autumn mist!
Whither away?
Who 'mid his pleasures for a trifle cares?
Who aid will kindly render?
Who bade them thus apply the song?
Who bath drunk deep already.
Who bath me of thy love bereft?
Who brought them here so cleverly.
Who calls me?
Who comes this way? who's sneaking here?
Who deals their course unvaried till it falleth,
Who doth himself cry bravo, at the end,
Who doth ignore
Who every blossom in sweet spring-time flowering
Who every floweret from its stalk
Who float 'twixt heaven and earth dominion wielding,
Who from earth's trial throes,
Who from the fever's deadly blast,
Who from the gifts by him possessed
Who had a goodly flea,
Who had a goodly flea—
Who hesitates will never know it;
Who in the raging storm sees passion low'ring?
Who into long, long torment slept through thee?
Who it appears the Word doth rate so low;
Who knows the moment to embrace,
Who lieth here?
Who on efficient work is bent,
Who on the child its true name dares bestow?
Who prompts the helper and Who help doth send.
Who stirs, excites, and must, as devil, work.
Who strides with lofty paces?
Who that can feel,
Who their full hearts unguardedly reveal'd,
Who then art thou?
Who then the living would amuse? For they
Who thinketh not,
Who to you in the dance so sweetly sang?
Who towards me press'd with energy profound?
Who vainly strives to climb to-night,
Who will for you before the judge appear.
Who with my sister can compare?"
Who would not fall in love with you?
Who yonder gentleman could be!
Who'd take the trouble to dispute with fools?
Who'll teach me now? What ought Ito forego?
Who's sneaking here?
Who's that, pray?
Who's there?
Who, Nature's green familiar leaves entwining,
Who, as a rule, a treatise now would care
Who, headsman, unto thee this power
Who, in his spirit's depths affrighted,
Who, like the greedy surge, from rock to rock,
Who, of his own free will, therefrom would part?
Who, undeluded by mere outward show,
Who, when he understood the jest,
Who?
Whoever quarrels, turn him out!
Whole countries hath swallow'd down,
Wholesale annihilation won't prevail,
Wholly now he fills the room,
Whom are you luring here? I'll give it you!
Whom have we here?
Whom you instruct, is blest in sooth!
Whose blood is on thy threshold?
Whose genial wit the audience still inspires,
Whose vortex draws us with resistless might.
Why all this uproar? What's the master's pleasure?
Why at the threshold snuffest thou so?
Why choose ye that direction, pray?
Why court for such a paltry end?
Why how again it seethes and glows!
Why how is this? my hand's already lamed!
Why how those buxom girls step on!
Why let this thought your soul o'ercast?
Why like an owl sit moping here?
Why lingering stay
Why not?
Why on thy neck so anxious do I feel—
Why only look, you scarce can see the end.
Why ride so hard?
Why should you flare away so uselessly?
Why stand you thus, and gaze with wondering eyes?
Why talk of the poetic vein?
Why the dull ache will not depart,
Why thou shouldst ask, I cannot see.
Why through the window not withdraw?
Why wilt thou plague thyself with thrashing straw?
Why, child, of all strange notions, he
Why, this is nothing but a juggler's trick!
Why, women, do ye howl and wail?
Wife, child, slave, plough, whate'er its name!
Wildering escort, whirls along,
Will be the last of seven, and spick-span new—'
Will bend tile hearts of others to your own.
Will gain it in the end.
Will have diversion, ay, and 'tis their due.
Will it ascend into the open air?
Will lead you to her room this very day.
Will none but this old beldame do?
Will on the Sunday fondle you the best.
Will that too issue from the heart?
Will the dog snarl at them like men?
Willingly!
Winds the interminable thread of life;
Wine is sap, the vine is wood,
Wing the blue air;
Winging their airy flight,
Winging their way,
Wise as we are, yet Tegel hath its ghost!
Wiser than I am, you will find.
Witches and he-goats, a motley throng.
Witches; old and young; Wizards, Will-o'-the-Wisp, Witch Pedlar,
With Clever finger catch and Kill!
With Sweat and with blood
With a deeper glance and true
With all the fooleries of love,
With anguish sorely jaded;
With ardent furtive glance, the slender waist,
With ardent labour, studied through.
With billowy motion!
With blows their way towards the box they take;
With boxes round thee piled, and glass,
With brazen front insults the day:
With bristling hair now doth the creature swell.
With brother adepts he would spend,
With brother spheres in rival song,
With but Seven hours I could succeed;
With but one mortal happy, here and there?
With careless hand when round her spindle, Nature
With change still rife,
With college logic to begin!
With deference to your grace, he seems to me
With devils here united.
With diligence to study still I fondly cling;
With ease!
With easy quiet view the scene,
With fairest shapes your spells around him cast,
With fangs sharp-piercing, and keen arrowy tongue
With feelings of foreboding awe,
With fiery eye, terrific tooth!
With firm and conscientious will,
With frog and chirping cricket,
With front unblushing, and a dauntless breast?
With gentlemen like you indeed
With glad resolve to take the fatal leap,
With greed for treasure gropes, and, joy-inspir'd,
With guileful purpose our behests obey;
With heaving breast and many a burning tear,
With her broad eye she gazed in mine!
With her to play the fool; or old he-goat,
With hideous noise,
With his celestial singing.
With holy fire I will scorch thee yet!
With honest purpose to explore,
With honest zeal, but methods of his own,
With hundred shelves, confines me round;
With its foreboding presence?
With keener relish you'll your thirst allay.
With ladies one should ne'er presume to jest.
With life; while steeped in slumber's dew,
With little wit and much content,
With many a knightly vassal
With might, thou hast compelled me to appear,
With murderous hand hold not so fast!
With my own eyes, upon a cask astride,
With novelties your booth supply;
With old ancestral lumber blent—
With one long bound 'tis clear'd by man.
With open throat drink, roar, and shout.
With our infernal mixture thus, ere long,
With penetrative glance aspir'd to flow
With pious ceremonials blest.
With prescient yearnings pierce the core of earth,
With proper folks when we appear,
With pure and hallow'd weavings grew!
With rapid motion from on high,
With reverence is known to fame.
With ribbon, wreath, and coloured vest,
With sacred vehemence, to purer spheres.
With saws pragmatical, and maxims sage,
With searching feelers, she, no doubt,
With shows, and mocking charms delude thy soul,
With sighs, and hands in anguish press'd,
With small sharp shears, in insect guise
With solemn, awe-inspiring night;
With soothing power, thy radiance stole!
With sovereign sway my energies he guides,
With speed, thought baffling, unabating,
With spices and myrrh,
With stinging jest and taunting sneer!
With storms to wrestle, brave the lightning's glare,
With such distinguished guests. Come, no delay;
With sway quite too potential;
With sweet harmonies of happier days:
With that, clasp, chain, and ring, he swept
With the folk here each day's a holiday.
With the police I know my course to steer,
With thee will I abide.
With them we'll deck our Lady's shrine,
With thunder-march, his orb completing,
With tighten'd pressure in thy breast?
With toil fantastic loved to brood;
With varied colours in the flask
With violent blow;
With what delight, what profit too,
With what desire?
With what he saw was well content.
With wheel, and cog, and ring, and cylinder;
With woe, with woe, with woe,
With you he'll walk, he'll dance with none but you,
With your mad swarms of witchery!
Withdraweth his force, decrepid now.
Within me all is wintry. Frost and snow
Within my arms it stretched itself and grew,
Within my breast youth's throbbing pulse is bounding,
Within my press I've found to-day,
Within the very narrowest round,
Within whose mocking sphere our sense is bound!
Without its counterpart on earth; there's naught,
Without much knowledge we have but to swear.
Without one word of thanks, he kept,
Without physician, gold, or sorcery:
Without some gift my love to show.
Without the marriage ring!
Without! without!
Woe is me!
Woe to my garland!
Woe unto thee, that thou'rt a grandson born!
Woe!
Woe! Woe!
Woe! woe!
Woe! woe! Thy lips are cold,— Are dumb!
Woe! woe! they come! oh bitter 'tis to die!
Woe's me! I cannot bear the sight!
Woe's me! still prison'd in the gloom
Woe's me! well-nigh distraught I feel!
Woe's me, if thou naught better canst suggest!
Woe's thee!
Woman, no more that name employ!
Won't see them, or we'll coin some tale or other.
Words delusive cheat the ear! Be ye there, and be ye here!
Worm that thou art such rapture canst thou earn?
Worm-eaten, hid 'neath dust and mould,
Would I could happier tidings show!
Would I had never been born!
Would I knew aught to make my imprecation worse!
Would I were hence!
Would cordially delight them!
Would he but always in the grass repose!
Would him Sir Microcosmus name.
Would pluck, and deems nor grace, nor truth,
Would ye fondly love as we,
Would you could better occupy your leisure,
Would'st grasp the thunder? Well for you, poor mortals, that 'tis not yours to wield! To smite to atoms the being however innocent, who obstructs his path, such is the tyrant's fashion of relieving himself in difficulties!
Wouldst hide thee? sin and shame
Wouldst thou possess thy heritage, essay,
Wreathe's glory's garland, won on every field?
Wrenching the giant pine, which in its fall
Writhe nymph of the wave,
XENIEN
YE twain, in trouble and distress
YE wavering shapes, again ye do enfold me,
YOUNG WITCH
Yawn the huge trunks with mighty groan.
Ye angels! Ye angelic hosts! descend,
Ye breasts, ye fountains of all life, whereon
Ye deep-ton'd bells, do ye with voice sublime,
Ye gush, and must I languish in despair?
Ye have entranc'd him fairly with your numbers!
Ye in the midst should be of all this jovial cheer,
Ye instruments, forsooth, ye mock at me,—
Ye know, what quality ensures
Ye press around! Come then, your captive hold me,
Ye trip it deftly on the ground,
Yea, in my spirit's inmost depths abhor;
Yearning he left his own,
Yes!
Yes! day draws near.
Yes, I in God believe?
Yes, forth in the free air.
Yes, small our household is, I own,
Yes, we'll presently away.
Yet 'mong ourselves should one still lord it o'er the rest;
Yet 'mong themselves no weavers rise.—
Yet 'tis thyself, thy fond kind looks I see.
Yet I must own that then I scarcely knew
Yet I was angry with myself indeed,
Yet ah! thou poorest of the sons of earth,
Yet ah!—what urg'd me to transgress,
Yet am I right!
Yet barren evermore must be!
Yet did a certain man refrain one night,
Yet ever circulates the fresh young blood.
Yet fixed is this delusion in our heart;
Yet food thou hast which satisfieth never,
Yet has a relish for their wine.
Yet hath your heart no earnest preference known?
Yet he succeedeth not, for struggle as he will,
Yet here alone I care not to resort,
Yet here behold us dancing;
Yet here ye dance, as other mortals do!
Yet if, by me companion'd, thou
Yet it a relish gives to food and rest.
Yet land and ocean still unchang'd abide!
Yet like the gods of Greece, no doubt,
Yet must I see to it. No maid we keep,
Yet must his soul infallibly be lost!
Yet ne'er of failure felt so keen a dread;
Yet nothing in my booth you'll find
Yet now are all things turning round and round,
Yet once more must I trouble you:
Yet out of doors 'tis not so warm.
Yet stand you there
Yet still he flatter'd her aside,
Yet such strange fellows in the world must be!
Yet them I could not liars call.
Yet upon gala-days one must one's orders show.
Yet wherefore must the stream, alas, so soon be dry,
Yet write away without cessation,
Yet, if into the depth of things you go,
Yet, though I yearn to gaze on thee, I feel
Yon black hound
Yon brake allureth me; it is not far;
Yon cottage homes, girt round with verdant green!
Yonder doth the bagpipe come!
Yonder he hastens to diffuse new life.
Yonder one burning merrily, I see.
You are but making fun of us, I trow.
You are forsooth entitled to exclaim;
You are perhaps much alone?
You are upon the proper track, I find;
You by sheer bulk have won your reputation,
You cannot have the wine-casks at the door?
You cannot quickly, I protest,
You deepen my dislike. The youth
You double beast!
You give a piece, abroad in pieces send it!
You have it there!
You have them both!
You have them then to humour as you please.
You might achieve some useful ends.
You must not name it to your mother!
You must not wonder should we go astray.
You must with zeal to metaphysics turn!
You on the Blocksberg I'm rejoiced to find,
You really talk
You scapegrace! How;
You then at once those easy freedoms use
You'd better not repeat those words again t
You'll reach the lane of certainty at last.
You'll see a glorious revelation.
You're doubtless recently from Rippach? Pray,
You're right! Leipzig's the place for me
You've hit upon the very place.
You've made me swelter in a pretty style.
You, who in evil days of yore,
You, who so bright were wont to blaze,
Young witches there I see, naked and bare,
Your audience seek to mystify, cajole;—
Your bones consume!
Your business, Sir? I long to know
Your counsel I appreciate quite;
Your courtesy much flatters me!
Your dancing would approve,—especially
Your doting love-sick fool, with ease,
Your dying breath in slander will you spend?
Your father rescu'd, when his skill
Your feelings thrill with ecstasy.
Your fine harangues, so polish'd in their kind,
Your finish'd gentlemen you ne'er can please;
Your husband's dead, and greeteth you.
Your learned reverence humbly I salute!
Your pangs to sooth and aid your love,
Your pardon for my importunity;
Your pardon! 'tis delightful to transport
Your parting soul to God commend!
Your powder and your petticoat,
Your sense, the night's carouse inviteth.
Your skin still itching for a row?
Your skull shall follow next, I trow!
Your souls, rend away!
Your stoppers draw and drink your fill!
Your sweet and fostering tides—where are ye—where?
Your words I cannot fully comprehend.
Yourself with studious zeal prepare,
Youth, my good friend, you certainly require
