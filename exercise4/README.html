<h1>The task</h1>

Write an extension to the linux firewall which makes it possible to
specify which programs are allowed use which outgoing port. <P>

More precisely, you should write a user space program and a kernel
module. <P>

<h2> Firewall rules </h2>

A firewall rule consists of a port number and a filename (the full
path) of a program separated by a space, meaning that the
corresponding program is allowed to make outgoing connections on this
TCP-port. If there is no rule for a given port, any program should be
allowed to make outgoing connections on this port. A connection is not
allowed when rules for the port exist, but the program trying to
establish the connection is not in the list of allowed programs. If a
connection is not allowed, it should be immediately terminated. <P>

The kernel module processes the packets and maintains the firewall
rules, and displays the firewall rules via <em> printk</em> in <em>
/var/log/kern.log</em>. The output should be: <P>

Firewall rule: <em>&langle;port &rangle; &langle;program&rangle;</em> <P>

For every rule that is configured, <em>&langle;port&rangle;</em> is the port
number in decimal representation and <em>&langle;program&rangle;</em> is the full path to the executeable.

When the kernel module is unloaded, the firewall extensions should be deleted.

<h2> User space configuration</h2>

The user space program, which must be called <em>firewallSetup</em>,
has commands firstly for triggering the listing of the firewall rules
in <em>/var/log/kern.log</em>, and secondly for setting the firewall
rules. A new set of firewall rules overrides the old set (no
appending). You should use the file <em>/proc/firewallExtension</em>
for communication between the user program and the kernel. <P>

If replacing the set of firewall rules fails for any reason, the old
set of firewall rules should be retained. <P>

To make marking easier, there should be two ways of calling the user
space program. The first one is <P> 


firewallSetup L <P>


This way of calling the user space program causes the firewall rules
to be displayed in <em>/var/log/kern.log</em> as specified above. <P>

The second way of calling the program is <P>

firewallSetup W <em>&langle;filename&rangle;</em> <P>

where <em>&langle;filename&rangle;</em> is the name of the file containing the firewall
rules.  This file contains one firewall rule per line. <em>firewallSetup</em>
should check whether the filename in the firewall rule denotes an
existing executable file. If there is any error in the syntax or any
filename does not an executable file, this program should abort with
the messages <em>ERROR: Ill-formed file</em> and <em>ERROR: Cannot execute file</em>
respectively.

<h2> Submission</h2>
You should put all your files into a directory named exercise4 in your
project on the School's git server. The directory exercise4 must
be at the top level of your project for the marking scripts to work.
The directory exercise4 should contain a Makefile which builds the
kernel module which must be called firewallExtension.ko. This
directory must also contain a subdirectory called Setup. This
subdirectory must contain a Makefile which builds the
firewallSetup-binary.
We will run the command make in the directory exercise4 in order to
obtain the kernel module, and we will run make in the subdirectory
Setup to obtain the FirewallSetup-binary.
Do not use any files or directory with the
prefix "test", since we will use such files for running tests.
Submission consists of pushing your solution to your project as
specified above; the last
submission before the submission deadline counts as your
submission. It is worth trying out submission well before the deadline
even if the solution is not correct yet. Because of differences
between kernel versions it is important that you use the provided
kernel version, which is  4.4.0-93-generic.


<h2> General Coding </h2>

Your kernel code may assume that only well-formed files are written by firewallSetup.

Only one process should be allowed to open the
<em>/proc/firewallExtension</em> file at any give time. If a second
process tries to open this file it should receive the error message <em>-EAGAIN</em>.

You need to ensure that you handle concurrency in the kernel correctly. In particular, any number of outgoing connections may be started at any time, hence several instances of the procedures handling the packets may be executed at the same time. It is very important that you maximize the degree of parallelism. In particular, your critical sections should be as short as possible.

We recommend using the APIS for linked lists, locking and the Basic C Library functions provided by the kernel. Please be careful to check all buffer boundaries. 

Do not modify or add files or directories that start with _test_ since we will use those files to test your project.

We have provided a test script for development in the file <em>test.sh</em>.
For marking we will use additional, more advanced, test scripts which check whether your program satisfies the specification. If the provided test scripts fail, all the more advanced test scripts are likely to fail as well.
Any submission which does not compile will be awarded 0 marks and will not be reviewed.
